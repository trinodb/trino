  # Testcontainers kills image pulls if they don't make progress for > 30s and retries for 2m before failing. This means
  # that if an image doesn't download all it's layers within ~2m then any other concurrent pull will be killed because
  # the Docker daemon only downloads 3 layers concurrently which prevents the other pull from making any progress.
  # This value should be greater than the time taken for the longest image pull.
