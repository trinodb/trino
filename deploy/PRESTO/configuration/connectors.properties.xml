  <property>
    <name>connectors.to.add</name>
    <value>{}</value>
    <description>
        Modify this property to add connectors. The format should be {'connector1':
        ['key1=value1', 'key2=value2'..], 'connector2' :['key1=value1',
        'key2=value2'..]..}. Note the single quotes around each value! This example will
        create files connector1.properties, connector2.properties for Presto with entries
        key1=value1 etc. If you don't want to add any connectors then leave the value as {};
        Ambari will not accept an empty value for this property. For deleting connectors, please
        use the connectors.to.remove property.
