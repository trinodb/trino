# Installation

A Trino server can be installed and deployed on a number of different
platforms. Typically you run a cluster of machines with one coordinator and many
workers. You can find instructions for deploying such a cluster, and related
information, in the following sections:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

installation/deployment
installation/containers
installation/kubernetes
installation/query-resiliency
```

Once you have a completed the deployment, or if you have access to a running
cluster already, you can proceed to configure your {doc}`client application
</client>`.
