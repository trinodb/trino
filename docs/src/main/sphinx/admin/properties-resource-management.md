(prop-resource-query-max-cpu-time)=
## `query.max-cpu-time`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-duration`
- **Default value:** `1_000_000_000d`

This is the max amount of CPU time that a query can use across the entire
cluster. Queries that exceed this limit are killed.

(prop-resource-query-max-memory-per-node)=
## `query.max-memory-per-node`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-heap-size`
- **Default value:** (30% of maximum heap size on the node)

This is the max amount of user memory a query can use on a worker.
User memory is allocated during execution for things that are directly
attributable to, or controllable by, a user query. For example, memory used
by the hash tables built during execution, memory used during sorting, etc.
When the user memory allocation of a query on any worker hits this limit,
it is killed.

:::{warning}
The sum of {ref}`prop-resource-query-max-memory-per-node` and
{ref}`prop-resource-memory-heap-headroom-per-node` must be less than the
maximum heap size in the JVM on the node. See {ref}`jvm-config`.

:::{note}
Does not apply for queries with task level retries enabled (`retry-policy=TASK`)

(prop-resource-query-max-memory)=
## `query.max-memory`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-data-size`
- **Default value:** `20GB`

This is the max amount of user memory a query can use across the entire cluster.
User memory is allocated during execution for things that are directly
attributable to, or controllable by, a user query. For example, memory used
by the hash tables built during execution, memory used during sorting, etc.
When the user memory allocation of a query across all workers hits this limit
it is killed.

:::{warning}
{ref}`prop-resource-query-max-total-memory` must be greater than
{ref}`prop-resource-query-max-memory`.

:::{note}
Does not apply for queries with task level retries enabled (`retry-policy=TASK`)
:::

(prop-resource-query-max-total-memory)=
## `query.max-total-memory`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-data-size`
- **Default value:** (`query.max-memory` * 2)

This is the max amount of memory a query can use across the entire cluster,
including revocable memory. When the memory allocated by a query across all
workers hits this limit it is killed. The value of `query.max-total-memory`
must be greater than `query.max-memory`.

:::{warning}
{ref}`prop-resource-query-max-total-memory` must be greater than
{ref}`prop-resource-query-max-memory`.

(prop-resource-memory-heap-headroom-per-node)=
## `memory.heap-headroom-per-node`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-heap-size`
- **Default value:** (30% of maximum heap size on the node)

This is the amount of memory set aside as headroom/buffer in the JVM heap
for allocations that are not tracked by Trino.

:::{warning}
The sum of {ref}`prop-resource-query-max-memory-per-node` and
{ref}`prop-resource-memory-heap-headroom-per-node` must be less than the
maximum heap size in the JVM on the node. See {ref}`jvm-config`.
:::

(prop-resource-exchange-deduplication-buffer-size)=
## `exchange.deduplication-buffer-size`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-data-size`
- **Default value:** `32MB`

Size of the buffer used for spooled data during
{doc}`/admin/fault-tolerant-execution`.
