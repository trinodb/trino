# OpenLineage event listener

The OpenLineage event listener plugin allows streaming of lineage information,
encoded in
JSON format aligned with OpenLineage specification, to an external, OpenLineage
compatible API, by POSTing them
to a specified URI.

## Rationale

This event listener is aiming to capture every query that creates or modifies
Trino tables and transform it into lineage
information. Linage can be understood as relationship/flow between data/tables.
OpenLineage is a widely used open-source
standard for capturing lineage information from variety of system including (but
not limited to) Spark, Airflow, Flink.

### Available Trino Facets

#### Trino Metadata

Facet containing properties (if present):

- `queryPlan`
- `transactionId` - transaction id used for query processing

related to query based on which OpenLineage Run Event was generated.

Available in both `Start` and `Complete/Fail` OpenLineage events.

If you want to disable this facet, add `trino_metadata` to 
`openlineage-event-listener.disabled-facets`.

#### Trino Query Context

Facet containing properties:

- `serverVersion` - version of Trino server that was used to process the query
- `environment` - inherited from `node.environment` of [](node-properties)
- `queryType` - one of query types configured via 
  `openlineage-event-listener.trino.include-query-types`

related to query based on which OpenLineage Run Event was generated.

Available in both `Start` and `Complete/Fail` OpenLineage events.

If you want to disable this facet, add `trino_query_context` to
`openlineage-event-listener.disabled-facets`.

#### Trino Query Statistics

Facet containing full contents of query statistics of completed. Available only
in OpenLineage `Complete/Fail` events.

If you want to disable this facet, add `trino_query_statistics` to
`openlineage-event-listener.disabled-facets`.

## Requirements

You need to perform the following steps:

- Provide an HTTP/S service that accepts POST events with a JSON body and is
  compatible with the OpenLineage API format.
- Configure `openlineage-event-listener.transport.url` in the event listener
  properties file with the URI of the service
- Configure `openlineage-event-listener.trino.uri` so proper OpenLineage job 
  namespace is render within produced events. Needs to be proper uri with scheme,
  host and port (otherwise plugin will fail to start).
- Configure what events to send as detailed
  in [](openlineage-event-listener-configuration)

(openlineage-event-listener-configuration)=

## Configuration

To configure the OpenLineage event listener, create an event listener properties
file in `etc` named `openlineage-event-listener.properties` with the following
contents as an example of minimal required configuration:

```properties
event-listener.name=openlineage
openlineage-event-listener.trino.uri=<Address of your Trino coordinator>
```

Add `etc/openlineage-event-listener.properties` to `event-listener.config-files`
in [](config-properties):

```properties
event-listener.config-files=etc/openlineage-event-listener.properties,...
```

### Supported Transport Types

- `CONSOLE` - sends OpenLineage JSON event to Trino coordinator standard output.
- `HTTP` - sends OpenLineage JSON event to OpenLineage compatible HTTP endpoint.

(openlineage-event-listener-custom-headers)=

### Custom HTTP headers

Providing custom HTTP headers is a useful mechanism for sending metadata along 
with event messages.

Providing headers follows the pattern of `key:value` pairs separated by commas:

```text
openlineage-event-listener.transport.headers="Header-Name-1:header value 1,Header-Value-2:header value 2,..."
```

If you need to use a comma(`,`) or colon(`:`) in a header name or value,
escape it using a backslash (`\`).

Keep in mind that these are static, so they can not carry information
taken from the event itself.

(openlineage-event-listener-custom-url-params)=

### Custom URL Params

Providing additional URL Params included in final HTTP Request.

Providing url params follows the pattern of `key:value` pairs separated by commas:

```text
openlineage-event-listener.transport.url-params="Param-Name-1:param value 1,Param-Value-2:param value 2,..."
```

Keep in mind that these are static, so they can not carry information
taken from the event itself.
