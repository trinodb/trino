# Write partitioning properties

(preferred-write-partitioning)=
## `use-preferred-write-partitioning`

- **Type:** {ref}`prop-type-boolean`
- **Default value:** `true`
- **Session property:** `use_preferred_write_partitioning`

Enable preferred write partitioning. When set to `true`, each partition is
written by a separate writer. For some connectors such as the Hive connector,
only a single new file is written per partition, instead of multiple files.
Partition writer assignments are distributed across worker nodes for parallel
processing.
