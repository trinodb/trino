# System access control

A system access control enforces authorization at a global level,
before any connector level authorization. You can use one of the built-in
implementations in Trino, or provide your own by following the guidelines in
{doc}`/develop/system-access-control`.

To use a system access control, add an `etc/access-control.properties` file
with the following content and the desired system access control name on all
cluster nodes:

```text
access-control.name=allow-all
```

Multiple system access control implementations may be configured at once
using the `access-control.config-files` configuration property. It should
contain a comma separated list of the access control property files to use
(rather than the default `etc/access-control.properties`).

Trino offers the following built-in system access control implementations:

:::{list-table}
:widths: 20, 80
:header-rows: 1

* - Name
  - Description
* - `default`
  - All operations are permitted, except for user impersonation and triggering
    [](/admin/graceful-shutdown).

    This is the default access control if none are configured.
* - `allow-all`
  - All operations are permitted.
* - `read-only`
  - Operations that read data or metadata are permitted, but none of the
    operations that write data or metadata are allowed.
* - `file`
  - Authorization rules are specified in a config file. See
    [](/security/file-system-access-control).
* - `opa`
  - Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) for authorization. See
    [](/security/opa-access-control).
* - `ranger`
  - Use Apache Ranger policies for authorization. See
    [](/security/apache-ranger-access-control).

If you want to limit access on a system level in any other way than the ones
listed above, you must implement a custom {doc}`/develop/system-access-control`.

Access control must be configured on the coordinator. Authorization for
operations on specific worker nodes, such a triggering
{doc}`/admin/graceful-shutdown`, must also be configured on all workers.

## Read only system access control

This access control allows any operation that reads data or
metadata, such as `SELECT` or `SHOW`. Setting system level or catalog level
session properties is also permitted. However, any operation that writes data or
metadata, such as `CREATE`, `INSERT` or `DELETE`, is prohibited.
To use this access control, add an `etc/access-control.properties`
file with the following contents:

```text
access-control.name=read-only
```
