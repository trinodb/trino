# Open Policy Agent access control

The Open Policy Agent access control plugin enables the use of [Open Policy
Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) as authorization engine for
fine-grained access control to catalogs, schemas, tables, and more in Trino.
Policies are defined in OPA, and Trino checks access control privileges in OPA.

## Requirements

* A running [OPA deployment](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa)
* Network connectivity from the Trino cluster to the OPA server

With the requirements fulfilled, you can proceed to set up Trino and OPA with
your desired access control configuration.

## Trino configuration

To use only OPA for access control, create the file `etc/access-control.properties`
with the following minimal configuration:

```properties
access-control.name=opa
opa.policy.uri=https://opa.example.com/v1/data/trino/allow
```

To combine OPA access control with file-based or other access control
systems, follow the instructions about [](multiple-access-control).

The following table lists the configuration properties for the OPA access control:

:::{list-table} OPA access control configuration properties
:widths: 40, 60
:header-rows: 1

* - Name
  - Description
* - `opa.policy.uri`
  - The **required** URI for the OPA endpoint, for example,
    `https://opa.example.com/v1/data/trino/allow`.
* - `opa.policy.row-filters-uri`
  - The **optional** URI for fetching row filters - if not set no row filtering
    is applied. For example, `https://opa.example.com/v1/data/trino/rowFilters`.
* - `opa.policy.column-masking-uri`
  - The **optional** URI for fetching column masks - if not set no masking
    is applied. For example, `https://opa.example.com/v1/data/trino/columnMask`.
* - `opa.policy.batch-column-masking-uri`
  -  The **optional** URI for fetching columns masks in batches; must **not**
     be used with `opa.policy.column-masking-uri`. For example,
     `http://opa.example.com/v1/data/trino/batchColumnMasks`.
* - `opa.policy.batched-uri`
  - The **optional** URI for activating batch mode for certain authorization
    queries where batching is applicable, for example
    `https://opa.example.com/v1/data/trino/batch`. Batch mode is described
    [](opa-batch-mode).
* - `opa.log-requests`
  - Configure if request details, including URI, headers and the entire body, are
    logged prior to sending them to OPA. Defaults to `false`.
* - `opa.log-responses`
  - Configure if OPA response details, including URI, status code, headers and
    the entire body, are logged. Defaults to `false`.
* - `opa.allow-permission-management-operations`
  - Configure if permission management operations are allowed. Find more details in
    [](opa-permission-management). Defaults to `false`.
* - `opa.http-client.*`
  - Optional HTTP client configurations for the connection from Trino to OPA,
    for example `opa.http-client.http-proxy` for configuring the HTTP proxy.
    Find more details in [](/admin/properties-http-client).

### Logging

When request or response logging is enabled, details are logged at the `DEBUG`
level under the `io.trino.plugin.opa.OpaHttpClient` logger. The Trino logging
configuration must be updated to include this class, to ensure log entries are
created.

Note that enabling these options produces very large amounts of log data.

(opa-permission-management)=
### Permission management

The following operations are allowed or denied based on the setting of
`opa.allow-permission-management-operations` If set to `true`, these operations are
allowed. If set to `false`, they are denied. In both cases, no request is sent
to OPA.

- `GrantSchemaPrivilege`
- `DenySchemaPrivilege`
- `RevokeSchemaPrivilege`
- `GrantTablePrivilege`
- `DenyTablePrivilege`
- `RevokeTablePrivilege`
- `CreateRole`
- `DropRole`
- `GrantRoles`
- `RevokeRoles`

The setting defaults to `false` due to the complexity and potential unexpected
consequences of having SQL-style grants and roles together with OPA.

You must enable permission management if another custom security system in Trino
is capable of grant management and used together with OPA access control.

Additionally, users are always allowed to show information about roles (`SHOW
ROLES`), regardless of this setting. The following operations are _always_
allowed:

- `ShowRoles`
- `ShowCurrentRoles`
- `ShowRoleGrants`

## OPA configuration

The OPA access control in Trino contacts OPA for each query and issues an
authorization request. OPA must return a response containing a boolean `allow`
field, which determines whether the operation is permitted or not.

Policies in OPA are defined with the purpose built policy language Rego. Find
more information in the [detailed
documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).
After the initial installation and configuration in Trino, these policies are
the main configuration aspect for your access control setup.

A query from the OPA access control in Trino to OPA contains a `context` and an
`action` as its top level fields.

The `context` object contains all other contextual information about the query:

- `identity`: The identity of the user performing the operation, containing the
  following two fields:
  - `user`: username
  - `groups`: list of groups this user belongs to
- `softwareStack`: Information about the software stack issuing the request to
  OPA. The following information is included:
  - `trinoVersion`: Version of Trino used

The `action` object contains information about what action is performed on what
resources. The following fields are provided:

- `operation`: the performed operation, for example `SelectFromColumns`.
- `resource`: information about the accessed objects
- `targetResource`: information about any newly created object, if applicable
- `grantee`: grantee of a grant operation.

Fields that are not applicable for a specific operation are set to null.
Examples are an empty  `targetResource` if not modifying a table or schema or
catalog is modified, or an empty `grantee` if not granting permissions is set.
Any null field is omitted altogether from the `action` object.

### Example requests to OPA

Accessing a table results in a query similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "identity": {
      "user": "foo",
      "groups": ["some-group"]
    },
    "softwareStack": {
      "trinoVersion": "434"
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "operation": "SelectFromColumns",
    "resource": {
      "table": {
        "catalogName": "example_catalog",
        "schemaName": "example_schema",
        "tableName": "example_table",
        "columns": [
          "column1",
          "column2",
          "column3"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `targetResource` is used in cases where a new resource, distinct from the one in
`resource` is created. For example, when renaming a table.

```json
{
  "context": {
    "identity": {
      "user": "foo",
      "groups": ["some-group"]
    },
    "softwareStack": {
      "trinoVersion": "434"
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "operation": "RenameTable",
    "resource": {
      "table": {
        "catalogName": "example_catalog",
        "schemaName": "example_schema",
        "tableName": "example_table"
      }
    },
    "targetResource": {
      "table": {
        "catalogName": "example_catalog",
        "schemaName": "example_schema",
        "tableName": "new_table_name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Row filtering

Row filtering allows Trino to remove some rows from the result before returning
it to the caller, controlling what data different users can see. The plugin
supports retrieving filter definitions from OPA by configuring the OPA endpoint
for row filter processing with `opa.policy.row-filters-uri`.

For example, an OPA policy for row filtering may be defined by the following
rego script:

```text
  package trino
  import future.keywords.in
  import future.keywords.if
  import future.keywords.contains

  default allow := true

  table_resource := input.action.resource.table
  is_admin {
    input.context.identity.user == "admin"
  }

  rowFilters contains {"expression": "user_type <> 'customer'"} if {
      not is_admin
      table_resource.catalogName == "sample_catalog"
      table_resource.schemaName == "sample_schema"
      table_resource.tableName == "restricted_table"
  }
```

The response expected by the plugin is an array of objects, each of them in the
format `{"expression":"clause"}`. Each expression essentially behaves like an
additional `WHERE` clause. The script can also return multiple row filters for a
single OPA request, and all filters are subsequently applied.

Each object may contain an identity field. The identity field allows Trino to
evaluate these row filters under a **different** identity - such that a filter
can target a column the requesting user cannot see.

## Column masking

Column masking allows Trino to obscure data in one or more columns of the result
set for specific users, without outright denying access. The plugin supports
fetching column masks from OPA by configuring the OPA endpoint for columns mask
processing with `opa.policy.column-masking-uri` in the opa-plugin configuration.

For example, a policy configuring column masking may be defined by the following
rego script:

```text
  package trino
  import future.keywords.in
  import future.keywords.if
  import future.keywords.contains

  default allow := true

  column_resource := input.action.resource.column
  is_admin {
    input.context.identity.user == "admin"
  }

  columnMask := {"expression": "NULL"} if {
      not is_admin
      column_resource.catalogName == "sample_catalog"
      column_resource.schemaName == "sample_schema"
      column_resource.tableName == "restricted_table"
      column_resource.columnName == "user_phone"
  }

  columnMask := {"expression": "'****' || substring(user_name, -3)"} if {
      not is_admin
      column_resource.catalogName == "sample_catalog"
      column_resource.schemaName == "sample_schema"
      column_resource.tableName == "restricted_table"
      column_resource.columnName == "user_name"
  }
```

Unlike row filtering, only a **single column mask** may be returned for a given
column.

The same "identity" field may be returned to evaluate column masks under a
different identity.

### Batch column masking

If column masking is enabled, by default, the plugin will fetch each column
mask individually from OPA. When working with very wide tables this
can result in a performance degradation.

Configuring `opa.policy.batch-column-masking-uri` allows Trino to fetch the masks
for multiple columns in a single request. The list of requested columns is included
in the request under `action.filterResources`.

If `opa.policy.batch-column-masking-uri` is set it overrides the value of
`opa.policy.column-masking-uri` so that the plugin uses batch column
masking.

An OPA policy supporting batch column masking must return a list of objects,
each containing the following data:
- `viewExpression`:
    - `expression`: the expression to apply to the column, as a string
    - `identity` (optional): the identity to evaluate the expression as, as a
      string
- `index`: a reference the index of the column in the request to which this mask
  applies

For example, a policy configuring batch column masking may be defined by the
following rego script:

```text
package trino
import future.keywords.in
import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.contains

default allow := true

batchColumnMasks contains {
  "index": i,
  "viewExpression": {
    "expression": "NULL"
  }
} if {
  some i
  column_resource := input.action.filterResources[i]
  column_resource.catalogName == "sample_catalog"
  column_resource.schemaName == "sample_schema"
  column_resource.tableName == "restricted_table"
  column_resource.columnName == "user_phone"
}


batchColumnMasks contains {
  "index": i,
  "viewExpression": {
    "expression": "'****' || substring(user_name, -3)",
    "identity": "admin"
  }
} if {
  some i
  column_resource := input.action.filterResources[i]
  column_resource.catalogName == "sample_catalog"
  column_resource.schemaName == "sample_schema"
  column_resource.tableName == "restricted_table"
  column_resource.columnName == "user_name"
}
```

A batch column masking request is similar to the following example:

```json
{
    "context": {
        "identity": {
            "user": "foo",
            "groups": ["some-group"]
        },
        "softwareStack": {
            "trinoVersion": "434"
        }
    },
    "action": {
        "operation": "GetColumnMask",
        "filterResources": [
            {
                "column": {
                    "catalogName": "sample_catalog",
                    "schemaName": "sample_schema",
                    "tableName": "restricted_table",
                    "columnName": "user_phone",
                    "columnType": "VARCHAR"
                }
            },
            {
                "column": {
                    "catalogName": "sample_catalog",
                    "schemaName": "sample_schema",
                    "tableName": "restricted_table",
                    "columnName": "user_name",
                    "columnType": "VARCHAR"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The related OPA response is displayed in the following snippet:

```json
[
    {
        "index": 0,
        "viewExpression": {
            "expression": "NULL"
        }
    },
    {
        "index": 1,
        "viewExpression": {
            "expression": "'****' || substring(user_name, -3)",
            "identity": "admin"
        }
    }
]
```

(opa-batch-mode)=
## Batch mode

A very powerful feature provided by OPA is its ability to respond to
authorization queries with more complex answers than a `true` or `false` boolean
value.

Many features in Trino require filtering to determine to which resources a user
is granted access. These resources are catalogs, schema, queries, views, and
others objects.

If `opa.policy.batched-uri` is not configured, Trino sends one request to OPA
for each object, and then creates a filtered list of permitted objects.

Configuring `opa.policy.batched-uri` allows Trino to send a request to
the batch endpoint, with a list of resources in one request using the
under `action.filterResources` node.

All other fields in the request are identical to the non-batch endpoint.

An OPA policy supporting batch operations must return a list containing the
_indices_ of the items for which authorization is granted. Returning a `null`
value or an empty list is equivalent and denies any access.

You can add batching support for policies that do not support it:

```text
package foo

import future.keywords.contains

# ... rest of the policy ...
# this assumes the non-batch response field is called "allow"
batch contains i {
    some i
    raw_resource := input.action.filterResources[i]
    allow with input.action.resource as raw_resource
}

# Corner case: filtering columns is done with a single table item, and many columns inside
# We cannot use our normal logic in other parts of the policy as they are based on sets
# and we need to retain order
batch contains i {
    some i
    input.action.operation == "FilterColumns"
    count(input.action.filterResources) == 1
    raw_resource := input.action.filterResources[0]
    count(raw_resource["table"]["columns"]) > 0
    new_resources := [
        object.union(raw_resource, {"table": {"column": column_name}})
        | column_name := raw_resource["table"]["columns"][_]
    ]
    allow with input.action.resource as new_resources[i]
}
```
