# JWT authentication

Trino can be configured to authenticate client access using [JSON web tokens](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). A JWT is a small, web-safe
JSON file that contains cryptographic information similar to a certificate,
including:

- Subject
- Valid time period
- Signature

A JWT is designed to be passed between servers as proof of prior authentication
in a workflow like the following:

1. An end user logs into a client application and requests access to a server.

2. The server sends the user's credentials to a separate authentication service
   that:

   - validates the user
   - generates a JWT as proof of validation
   - returns the JWT to the requesting server

3. The same JWT can then be forwarded to other services to maintain the user's
   validation without further credentials.

:::{important}
If you are trying to configure OAuth2 or OIDC, there is a dedicated system
for that in Trino, as described in {doc}`/security/oauth2`. When using
OAuth2 authentication, you do not need to configure JWT authentication,
because JWTs are handled automatically by the OAuth2 code.

A typical use for JWT authentication is to support administrators at large
sites who are writing their own single sign-on or proxy system to stand
between users and the Trino coordinator, where their new system submits
queries on behalf of users.
:::

Using {doc}`TLS <tls>` and {doc}`a configured shared secret
</security/internal-communication>` is required for JWT authentication.

## Using JWT authentication

Trino supports Base64 encoded JWTs, but not encrypted JWTs.

There are two ways to get the encryption key necessary to validate the JWT
signature:

- Load the key from a JSON web key set (JWKS) endpoint service (the
  typical case)
- Load the key from the local file system on the Trino coordinator

A JWKS endpoint is a read-only service that contains public key information in
[JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) format. These public
keys are the counterpart of the private keys that sign JSON web tokens.

## JWT authentication configuration

Enable JWT authentication by setting the {doc}`JWT authentication type
<authentication-types>` in {ref}`etc/config.properties <config-properties>`, and
specifying a URL or path to a key file:

```properties
http-server.authentication.type=JWT
http-server.authentication.jwt.key-file=https://cluster.example.net/.well-known/jwks.json
```

JWT authentication is typically used in addition to other authentication
methods:

```properties
http-server.authentication.type=PASSWORD,JWT
http-server.authentication.jwt.key-file=https://cluster.example.net/.well-known/jwks.json
```

The following configuration properties are available:

:::{list-table} Configuration properties for JWT authentication
:widths: 50 50
:header-rows: 1

* - Property
  - Description
* - `http-server.authentication.jwt.key-file`
  - Required. Specifies either the URL to a JWKS service or the path to a PEM or
    HMAC file, as described below this table.
* - `http-server.authentication.jwt.required-issuer`
  - Specifies a string that must match the value of the JWT's issuer (`iss`)
    field in order to consider this JWT valid. The `iss` field in the JWT
    identifies the principal that issued the JWT.
* - `http-server.authentication.jwt.required-audience`
  - Specifies a string that must match the value of the JWT's Audience (`aud`)
    field in order to consider this JWT valid. The `aud` field in the JWT
    identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for.
* - `http-server.authentication.jwt.principal-field`
  - String to identify the field in the JWT that identifies the subject of the
    JWT. The default value is `sub`. This field is used to create the Trino
    principal.
* - `http-server.authentication.jwt.user-mapping.pattern`
  - A regular expression pattern to [map all user names](/security/user-mapping)
    for this authentication system to the format expected by the Trino server.
* - `http-server.authentication.jwt.user-mapping.file`
  - The path to a JSON file that contains a set of [user mapping
    rules](/security/user-mapping) for this authentication system.
:::

Use the `http-server.authentication.jwt.key-file` property to specify
either:

- The URL to a JWKS endpoint service, where the URL begins with `https://`.
  The JWKS service must be reachable from the coordinator. If the coordinator
  is running in a secured or firewalled network, the administrator *may* have
  to open access to the JWKS server host.

  :::{caution}
  The Trino server also accepts JWKS URLs that begin with `http://`, but
  using this protocol results in a severe security risk. Only use this
  protocol for short-term testing during development of your cluster.
  :::

- The path to a local file in {doc}`PEM </security/inspect-pem>` or [HMAC](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) format that contains a single key.
  If the file path contains `${KID}`, then Trino interpolates the `kid`
  from the JWT header into the file path before loading this key. This enables support
  for setups with multiple keys.

## Using JWTs with clients

When using the Trino {doc}`CLI </client/cli>`, specify a JWT as described
in {ref}`cli-jwt-auth`.

When using the Trino JDBC driver, specify a JWT with the `accessToken`
{ref}`parameter <jdbc-parameter-reference>`.
