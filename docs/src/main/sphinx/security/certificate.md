# Certificate authentication

You can configure Trino to support client-provided certificates validated by the
Trino server on initial connection.

:::{important}
This authentication method is only provided to support sites that have an
absolute requirement for client authentication *and already have* client
certificates for each client. Sites in this category have an existing PKI
infrastructure, possibly including an onsite Certificate Authority (CA).

This feature is not appropriate for sites that need to generate a set of
client certificates in order to use this authentication type. Consider
instead using another {ref}`authentication type <cl-access-auth>`.
:::

Using {doc}`TLS <tls>` and {doc}`a configured shared secret
</security/internal-communication>` is required for certificate authentication.

## Using certificate authentication

All clients connecting with TLS/HTTPS go through the following initial steps:

1. The client attempts to contact the coordinator.
2. The coordinator returns its certificate to the client.
3. The client validates the server's certificate using the client's trust store.

A cluster with certificate authentication enabled goes through the following
additional steps:

4. The coordinator asks the client for its certificate.
5. The client responds with its certificate.
6. The coordinator verifies the client's certificate, using the coordinator's
   trust store.

Several rules emerge from these steps:

- Trust stores used by clients must include the certificate of the signer of
  the coordinator's certificate.
- Trust stores used by coordinators must include the certificate of the signer
  of client certificates.
- The trust stores used by the coordinator and clients do not need to be the
  same.
- The certificate that verifies the coordinator does not need to be the same as
  the certificate verifying clients.

Trino validates certificates based on the distinguished name (DN) from the
X.509 `Subject` field. You can use {doc}`user mapping
</security/user-mapping>` to map the subject DN to a Trino username.

There are three levels of client certificate support possible. From the point of
view of the server:

- The server does not require a certificate from clients.
- The server asks for a certificate from clients, but allows connection without one.
- The server must have a certificate from clients to allow connection.

Trino's client certificate support is the middle type. It asks for a certificate
but allows connection if another authentication method passes.

## Certificate authentication configuration

Enable certificate authentication by setting the {doc}`Certificate
authentication type <authentication-types>` in {ref}`etc/config.properties
<config-properties>`:

```properties
http-server.authentication.type=CERTIFICATE
```

You can specify certificate authentication along with another authentication
method, such as `PASSWORD`. In this case, authentication is performed in the
order of entries, and the first successful authentication results in access.
For example, the following setting shows the use of two authentication types:

```properties
http-server.authentication.type=CERTIFICATE,PASSWORD
```

The following configuration properties are also available:

* - Property name
  - Description
* - `http-server.authentication.certificate.user-mapping.pattern`
  -  A regular expression pattern to [map all user
    names](/security/user-mapping) for this authentication type to the format
    expected by Trino.
* - `http-server.authentication.certificate.user-mapping.file`
  - The path to a JSON file that contains a set of [user mapping
    rules](/security/user-mapping) for this authentication type.

## Use certificate authentication with clients

When using the Trino {doc}`CLI </client/cli>`, specify the
`--keystore-path` and `--keystore-password` options as described
in {ref}`cli-certificate-auth`.

When using the Trino {doc}`JDBC driver </client/jdbc>` to connect to a
cluster with certificate authentication enabled, use the `SSLKeyStoreType` and
`SSLKeyStorePassword` {ref}`parameters <jdbc-parameter-reference>` to specify
the path to the client's certificate and its password, if any.
