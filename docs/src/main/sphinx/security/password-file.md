# Password file authentication

Trino can be configured to enable frontend password authentication over
HTTPS for clients, such as the CLI, or the JDBC and ODBC drivers. The
username and password are validated against usernames and passwords stored
in a file.

Password file authentication is very similar to {doc}`ldap`. Please see
the LDAP documentation for generic instructions on configuring the server
and clients to use TLS and authenticate with a username and password.

Using {doc}`TLS <tls>` and {doc}`a configured shared secret
</security/internal-communication>` is required for password file
authentication.

## Password authenticator configuration

To enable password file authentication, set the {doc}`password authentication
type <authentication-types>` in `etc/config.properties`:

```properties
http-server.authentication.type=PASSWORD
```

In addition, create a `etc/password-authenticator.properties` file on the
coordinator with the `file` authenticator name:

```text
password-authenticator.name=file
file.password-file=/path/to/password.db
```

The following configuration properties are available:

| Property                         | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file.password-file`             | Path of the password file.                                        |
| `file.refresh-period`            | How often to reload the password file. Defaults to `5s`.          |
| `file.auth-token-cache.max-size` | Max number of cached authenticated passwords. Defaults to `1000`. |

## Password files

### File format

The password file contains a list of usernames and passwords, one per line,
separated by a colon. Passwords must be securely hashed using bcrypt or PBKDF2.

bcrypt passwords start with `$2y$` and must use a minimum cost of `8`:

```text
test:$2y$10$BqTb8hScP5DfcpmHo5PeyugxHz5Ky/qf3wrpD7SNm8sWuA3VlGqsa
```

PBKDF2 passwords are composed of the iteration count, followed by the
hex encoded salt and hash:

```text
test:1000:5b4240333032306164:f38d165fce8ce42f59d366139ef5d9e1ca1247f0e06e503ee1a611dd9ec40876bb5edb8409f5abe5504aab6628e70cfb3d3a18e99d70357d295002c3d0a308a0
```

### Creating a password file

Password files utilizing the bcrypt format can be created using the
[htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html)
utility from the [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/).
The cost must be specified, as Trino enforces a higher minimum cost
than the default.

Create an empty password file to get started:

```text
touch password.db
```

Add or update the password for the user `test`:

```text
htpasswd -B -C 10 password.db test
```

### Verify configuration

To verify password file authentication, log in to the {doc}`Web UI
</admin/web-interface>`, and connect with the Trino {doc}`CLI </client/cli>` to
the cluster:

- Connect to the Web UI from your browser using a URL that uses HTTPS, such as
  `https://trino.example.com:8443`. Enter a username in the `Username` text
  box and the corresponding password in the `Password` text box, and log in to
  the UI. Confirm that you are not able to log in using an incorrect username
  and password combination. A successful login displays the username in the
  top right corner of the UI.
- Connect with the Trino CLI using a URL that uses HTTPS, such as
  `https://trino.example.net:8443` with the addition of the `--user` and
  `--password` properties:

```text
./trino --server https://trino.example.com:8443 --user test --password
```

The above command quotes you for a password. Supply the password set for the
user entered for the `--user` property to use the `trino>` prompt. Successful
authentication allows you to run queries from the CLI.

To test the connection, send a query:

```text
trino> SELECT 'rocks' AS trino;

trino
-------
rocks
(1 row)
