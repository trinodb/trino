# OAuth 2.0 authentication

Trino can be configured to enable OAuth 2.0 authentication over HTTPS for the
Web UI and the JDBC driver. Trino uses the [Authorization Code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1) flow which exchanges an
Authorization Code for a token. At a high level, the flow includes the following
steps:

1. the Trino coordinator redirects a user's browser to the Authorization Server
2. the user authenticates with the Authorization Server, and it approves the Trino's permissions request
3. the user's browser is redirected back to the Trino coordinator with an authorization code
4. the Trino coordinator exchanges the authorization code for a token

To enable OAuth 2.0 authentication for Trino, configuration changes are made on
the Trino coordinator. No changes are required to the worker configuration;
only the communication from the clients to the coordinator is authenticated.

Set the callback/redirect URL to `https://<trino-coordinator-domain-name>/oauth2/callback`,
when configuring an OAuth 2.0 authorization server like an OpenID Connect (OIDC)
provider.

If Web UI is enabled, set the post-logout callback URL to
`https://<trino-coordinator-domain-name>/ui/logout/logout.html` when configuring
an OAuth 2.0 authentication server like an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.

Using {doc}`TLS <tls>` and {doc}`a configured shared secret
</security/internal-communication>` is required for OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## OpenID Connect Discovery

Trino supports reading Authorization Server configuration from [OIDC provider
configuration metadata document](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).
During startup of the coordinator Trino retrieves the document and uses provided
values to set corresponding OAuth2 authentication configuration properties:

- `authorization_endpoint` -> `http-server.authentication.oauth2.auth-url`
- `token_endpoint` -> `http-server.authentication.oauth2.token-url`
- `jwks_uri` -> `http-server.authentication.oauth2.jwks-url`
- `userinfo_endpoint` ->  `http-server.authentication.oauth2.userinfo-url`
- `access_token_issuer` -> `http-server.authentication.oauth2.access-token-issuer`
- `end_session_endpoint` -> `http-server.authentication.oauth2.end-session-url`

:::{warning}
If the authorization server is issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and the
metadata document contains `userinfo_endpoint`, Trino uses this endpoint to
check the validity of OAuth2 access tokens. Since JWTs can be inspected
locally, using them against `userinfo_endpoint` may result in authentication
failure. In this case, set the
`http-server.authentication.oauth2.oidc.use-userinfo-endpoint` configuration
property to `false`
(`http-server.authentication.oauth2.oidc.use-userinfo-endpoint=false`). This
instructs Trino to ignore `userinfo_endpoint` and inspect tokens locally.
:::

This functionality is enabled by default but can be turned off with:
`http-server.authentication.oauth2.oidc.discovery=false`.

## Trino server configuration

Using the OAuth2 authentication requires the Trino coordinator to be secured
with TLS.

The following is an example of the required properties that need to be added
to the coordinator's `config.properties` file:

```properties
http-server.authentication.type=oauth2

http-server.https.port=8443
http-server.https.enabled=true

http-server.authentication.oauth2.issuer=https://authorization-server.com
http-server.authentication.oauth2.client-id=CLIENT_ID
http-server.authentication.oauth2.client-secret=CLIENT_SECRET
```

To enable OAuth 2.0 authentication for the Web UI, the following
property must be be added:

```properties
web-ui.authentication.type=oauth2
```

The following configuration properties are available:

:::{list-table} OAuth2 configuration properties
:widths: 40 60
:header-rows: 1

* - Property
  - Description
* - `http-server.authentication.type`
  - The type of authentication to use. Must  be set to `oauth2` to enable OAuth2
    authentication for the Trino coordinator.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.issuer`
  - The issuer URL of the IdP. All issued tokens must have this in the `iss`
    field.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.access-token-issuer`
  - The issuer URL of the IdP for access tokens, if different. All issued access
    tokens must have this in the `iss` field. Providing this value while OIDC
    discovery is enabled overrides the value from the OpenID provider metadata
    document. Defaults to the value of
    `http-server.authentication.oauth2.issuer`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.auth-url`
  - The authorization URL. The URL a user's browser will be redirected to in
    order to begin the OAuth 2.0 authorization process. Providing this value
    while OIDC discovery is enabled overrides the value from the OpenID provider
    metadata document.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.token-url`
  - The URL of the endpoint on the authorization server which Trino uses to
    obtain an access token. Providing this value while OIDC discovery is enabled
    overrides the value from the OpenID provider metadata document.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.jwks-url`
  - The URL of the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint on the authorization server.
    It provides Trino the set of keys containing the public key to verify any
    JSON Web Token (JWT) from the authorization server. Providing this value
    while OIDC discovery is enabled overrides the value from the OpenID provider
    metadata document.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.userinfo-url`
  - The URL of the IdPs `/userinfo` endpoint. If supplied then this URL is used
    to validate the OAuth access token and retrieve any associated claims. This
    is required if the IdP issues opaque tokens. Providing this value while OIDC
    discovery is enabled overrides the value from the OpenID provider metadata
    document.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.client-id`
  - The public identifier of the Trino client.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.client-secret`
  - The secret used to authorize Trino client with the authorization server.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.additional-audiences`
  - Additional audiences to trust in addition to the client ID which is
    always a trusted audience.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.scopes`
  - Scopes requested by the server during the authorization challenge. See:
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.challenge-timeout`
  - Maximum [duration](prop-type-duration) of the authorization challenge.
    Default is `15m`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.state-key`
  - A secret key used by the SHA-256 [HMAC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104)
    algorithm to sign the state parameter in order to ensure that the
    authorization request was not forged. Default is a random string generated
    during the coordinator start.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.user-mapping.pattern`
  - Regex to match against user. If matched, the user name is replaced with
    first regex group. If not matched, authentication is denied.  Default is
    `(.*)` which allows any user name.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.user-mapping.file`
  - File containing rules for mapping user. See [](/security/user-mapping) for
    more information.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.principal-field`
  - The field of the access token used for the Trino user principal. Defaults to
    `sub`. Other commonly used fields include `sAMAccountName`, `name`,
    `upn`, and `email`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.oidc.discovery`
  - Enable reading the [OIDC provider metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).
    Default is `true`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.oidc.discovery.timeout`
  - The timeout when reading OpenID provider metadata. Default is `30s`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.oidc.use-userinfo-endpoint`
  - Use the value of `userinfo_endpoint` in the [provider
    metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).
    When a `userinfo_endpoint` value is supplied this URL is used to validate
    the OAuth 2.0 access token, and retrieve any associated claims. This flag
    allows ignoring the value provided in the metadata document. Default is
    `true`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.end-session-url`
  - The URL of the endpoint on the authentication server to which the user's
    browser is redirected to so that End-User is logged out from the
    authentication server when logging out from Trino.

### Refresh tokens

*Refresh tokens* allow you to securely control the length of user sessions
within applications. The refresh token has a longer lifespan (TTL) and is used
to refresh the *access token* that has a shorter lifespan. When refresh tokens
are used in conjunction with access tokens, users can remain logged in for an
extended duration without interruption by another login request.

In a refresh token flow, there are three tokens with different expiration times:

- access token
- refresh token
- Trino-encrypted token that is a combination of the access and refresh tokens.
  The encrypted token manages the session lifetime with the timeout value that
  is set with the
  `http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.issued-token.timeout`
  property.

In the following scenario, the lifespan of the tokens issued by an IdP are:

- access token 5m
- refresh token 24h

Because the access token lifespan is only five minutes, Trino uses the longer
lifespan refresh token to request another access token every five minutes on
behalf of a user. In this case, the maximum
`http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.issued-token.timeout` is
twenty-four hours.

To use refresh token flows, the following property must be
enabled in the coordinator configuration.

```properties
http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens=true
```

Additional scopes for offline access might be required, depending on
IdP configuration.

```properties
http-server.authentication.oauth2.scopes=openid,offline_access [or offline]
```

The following configuration properties are available:

:::{list-table} OAuth2 configuration properties for refresh flow
:widths: 40 60
:header-rows: 1

* - Property
  - Description
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.issued-token.timeout`
  - Expiration time for an issued token, which is the Trino-encrypted token that
    contains an access token and a refresh token. The timeout value must be less
    than or equal to the [duration](prop-type-duration) of the refresh token
    expiration issued by the IdP. Defaults to `1h`. The timeout value is the
    maximum session time for an OAuth2-authenticated client with refresh tokens
    enabled. For more details, see [](trino-oauth2-troubleshooting).
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.issued-token.issuer`
  - Issuer representing the coordinator instance, that is referenced in the
    issued token, defaults to `Trino_coordinator`. The current Trino version is
    appended to the value. This is mainly used for debugging purposes.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.issued-token.audience`
  - Audience representing this coordinator instance, that is used in the
    issued token. Defaults to `Trino_coordinator`.
* - `http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.secret-key`
  - Base64-encoded secret key used to encrypt the generated token. By default
    it's generated during startup.

(trino-oauth2-troubleshooting)=
## Troubleshooting

To debug issues, change the [log level <log-levels>` for the OAuth 2.0
authenticator:

```none
io.trino.server.security.oauth2=DEBUG
```

To debug issues with OAuth 2.0 authentication use with the web UI, set the
following configuration property:

```none
io.trino.server.ui.OAuth2WebUiAuthenticationFilter=DEBUG
```

This assumes the OAuth 2.0 authentication for the Web UI is enabled as described
in {ref}`trino-server-configuration-oauth2`.

The logged debug error for a lapsed refresh token is `Tokens refresh challenge
has failed`.

:::{warning}
If a refresh token lapses, the user session is interrupted and the user must
reauthenticate by logging in again. Ensure you set the
`http-server.authentication.oauth2.refresh-tokens.issued-token.timeout`
value to less than or equal to the duration of the refresh token expiration
issued by your IdP. Optimally, the timeout should be slightly less than the
refresh token lifespan of your IdP to ensure that sessions end gracefully.
