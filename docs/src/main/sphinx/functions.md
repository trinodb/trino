# Functions and operators

This section describes the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by
Trino. They allow you to implement complex capabilities and behavior of the
queries executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources.

Refer to the following sections for further details:

* [SQL data types and other general aspects](/language)
* [SQL statement and syntax reference](/sql)

In addition, Trino supports implementation of [custom
functions](/develop/functions) or [custom table
functions](/develop/table-functions) provided by a plugin, and creation of
[](/udf).

## Functions by name

If you are looking for a specific function or operator by name use
