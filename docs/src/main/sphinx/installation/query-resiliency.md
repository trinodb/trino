# Improve query processing resilience

You can configure Trino to be more resilient against failures during query
processing by enabling fault-tolerant execution. This allows Trino to handle
larger queries such as batch operations without worker node interruptions
causing the query to fail.

When configured, the Trino cluster buffers data used by workers during query
processing. If processing on a worker node fails for any reason, such as a
network outage or running out of available resources, the coordinator
reschedules processing of the failed piece of work on another worker. This
allows query processing to continue using buffered data.

## Architecture

The coordinator node uses a configured exchange manager service that buffers
data during query processing in an external location, such as an S3 object
storage bucket. Worker nodes send data to the buffer as they execute their
query tasks.

## Best practices and considerations

A fault-tolerant cluster is best suited for large batch queries. Users may
experience latency or similar behavior if they issue a high volume of
short-running queries on a fault-tolerant cluster. As such, it is recommended to
run a dedicated fault-tolerant cluster for handling batch operations, separate
from a cluster that is designated for a higher query volume.

Catalogs using the following connectors support fault-tolerant execution of read
and write operations:

- {doc}`/connector/delta-lake`
- {doc}`/connector/hive`
- {doc}`/connector/iceberg`
- {doc}`/connector/mysql`
- {doc}`/connector/postgresql`
- {doc}`/connector/sqlserver`

Catalogs using other connectors only support fault-tolerant execution of read
operations. When fault-tolerant execution is enabled on a cluster, write
operations fail on any catalogs that do not support fault-tolerant
execution of those operations.

The exchange manager may send a large amount of data to the exchange storage,
resulting in high I/O load on that storage. You can configure multiple storage
locations for use by the exchange manager to help balance the I/O load between
them.

## Configuration

The following steps describe how to configure a Trino cluster for
fault-tolerant execution with an S3-based exchange:

1. Set up an S3 bucket to use as the exchange storage. For this example we are
   using an AWS S3 bucket, but other storage options are described in the
   {doc}`reference documentation </admin/fault-tolerant-execution>`
   as well. You can use multiple S3 buckets for exchange storage.

   For each bucket in AWS, collect the following information:

   - S3 URI location for the bucket, such as `s3://exchange-spooling-bucket`
   - Region that the bucket is located in, such as `us-west-1`
   - AWS access and secret keys for the bucket

2. For a {doc}`Kubernetes deployment of Trino </installation/kubernetes>`, add
   the following exchange manager configuration in the
   `server.exchangeManager` and `additionalExchangeManagerProperties`
   sections of the Helm chart, using the gathered S3 bucket information:

   ```yaml
   server:
     exchangeManager:
       name=filesystem
       base-directories=s3://exchange-spooling-bucket-1,s3://exchange-spooling-bucket-2

   additionalExchangeManagerProperties:
     exchange.s3.region=us-west-1
     exchange.s3.aws-access-key=example-access-key
     exchange.s3.aws-secret-key=example-secret-key
   ```

   In non-Kubernetes installations, the same properties must be defined in an
   `exchange-manager.properties` configuration file on the coordinator and
   all worker nodes.

3. Add the following configuration for fault-tolerant execution in the
   `additionalConfigProperties:` section of the Helm chart:

   ```yaml
   additionalConfigProperties:
     retry-policy=TASK
   ```

   In non-Kubernetes installations, the same property must be defined in the
   `config.properties` file on the coordinator and all worker nodes.

4. Re-deploy your instance of Trino or, for non-Kubernetes
   installations, restart the cluster.

Your Trino cluster is now configured with fault-tolerant query
execution. If a query run on the cluster would normally fail due to an
interruption of query processing, fault-tolerant execution now resumes the
query processing to ensure successful execution of the query.

## Next steps

For more information about fault-tolerant execution, including simple query
retries that do not require an exchange manager and advanced configuration
operations, see the {doc}`reference documentation
