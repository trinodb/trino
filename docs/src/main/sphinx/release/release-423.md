# Release 423 (10 Aug 2023)

## General

* Add support for renaming nested fields in a column via `RENAME COLUMN`. ({issue}`16757`)
* Add support for setting the type of a nested field in a column via `SET DATA TYPE`. ({issue}`16959`)
* Add support for comments on materialized view columns. ({issue}`18016`)
* Add support for displaying all Unicode characters in string literals. ({issue}`5061`)
* Improve performance of `INSERT` and `CREATE TABLE AS ... SELECT` queries. ({issue}`18212`)

  views or `WITH` clauses. This may affect the semantics of queries that
  incorrectly rely on implementation-specific behavior. The old behavior can be
  restored via the `skip_redundant_sort` session property or the
  `optimizer.skip-redundant-sort` configuration property. ({issue}`18159`)

  `task.scale-writers.max-writer-count` configuration properties to reduce the
  memory requirements of queries that write data. ({issue}`18488`)
* Remove the deprecated `optimizer.use-mark-distinct` configuration property,
  which has been replaced with `optimizer.mark-distinct-strategy`. ({issue}`18540`)
* Fix query planning failure due to dynamic filters in
  [fault tolerant execution mode](/admin/fault-tolerant-execution). ({issue}`18383`)
* Fix `EXPLAIN` failure when a query contains `WHERE ... IN (NULL)`. ({issue}`18328`)

  columns. ({issue}`16822`)
* Add option to enforce that a filter on a partition key is present for
  query processing. This can be enabled by setting the
  ``delta.query-partition-filter-required`` configuration property or the
  ``query_partition_filter_required`` session property to ``true``.
  ({issue}`18345`)
* Improve performance of the `$history` system table. ({issue}`18427`)
* Improve memory accounting of the Parquet writer. ({issue}`18564`)
* Allow metadata changes on Delta Lake tables with
  [identity columns](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#identity-columns). ({issue}`18200`)
* Fix incorrectly creating files smaller than the configured
  `file_size_threshold` as part of `OPTIMIZE`. ({issue}`18388`)
* Fix query failure when a table has a file with a location ending with
  whitespace. ({issue}`18206`)

## Hive connector

* Add support for changing a column's type from `varchar` to `timestamp`. ({issue}`18014`)
* Improve memory accounting of the Parquet writer. ({issue}`18564`)
* Remove the legacy Parquet writer, along with the
  `parquet.optimized-writer.enabled` configuration property and the
  `parquet_optimized_writer_enabled ` session property. Replace the
  `parquet.optimized-writer.validation-percentage` configuration property with
  `parquet.writer.validation-percentage`. ({issue}`18420`)
* Disallow coercing Hive `timestamp` types to `varchar` for dates before 1900. ({issue}`18004`)
* Fix loss of data precision when coercing Hive `timestamp` values. ({issue}`18003`)
* Fix incorrectly creating files smaller than the configured
  `file_size_threshold` as part of `OPTIMIZE`. ({issue}`18388`)
* Fix query failure when a table has a file with a location ending with
  whitespace. ({issue}`18206`)
* Fix incorrect results when using S3 Select and a query predicate includes a
  quote character (`"`) or a decimal column. ({issue}`17775`)
* Add the `hive.s3select-pushdown.experimental-textfile-pushdown-enabled`
  configuration property to enable S3 Select pushdown for `TEXTFILE` tables. ({issue}`17775`)

  tables backed by AWS Glue as metastore.  ({issue}`18517`)
* Improve performance of `information_schema.columns` when using the Glue
  catalog. ({issue}`18586`)
* Improve memory accounting of the Parquet writer. ({issue}`18564`)
* Fix incorrectly creating files smaller than the configured
  `file_size_threshold` as part of `OPTIMIZE`. ({issue}`18388`)

* Fix failure to calculate query statistics when referring to `$path` as part of
  a `WHERE` clause. ({issue}`18330`)
* Fix write conflict detection for `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` operations.
  In rare situations this issue may have resulted in duplicate rows when
  multiple operations were run at the same time, or at the same time as an
  `optimize` procedure. ({issue}`18533`)

## SingleStore connector

* Add support for `CASCADE` option in `DROP SCHEMA` statements. ({issue}`18305`)

## SPI

  method signature. Connectors should implement
  `ConnectorMetadata.getTableHandle(ConnectorSession, SchemaTableName, Optional, Optional)`
  instead. ({issue}`18596`)
* Remove the deprecated `supportsReportingWrittenBytes` method from
  ConnectorMetadata. ({issue}`18617`)
