## Security

```{warning}
The file-based system and catalog access controls have changed in ways that reduce or increase permissions.
Please, read these release notes carefully.
```

* Change file-based catalog access control from deny to allow when table, schema, or session
  property rules are not defined. ({issue}`5039`)
* Add missing table rule checks for table and view DDL in file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)
* Add missing schema rule checks for create schema in file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)
* Add session property rules to file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)
* Add catalog regex to table and schema rules in file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)
* Change create, rename, alter, and drop table in file-based system controls to only check for
  table ownership.  ({issue}`5039`)
* Change file-based system access control to support files without catalog rules defined. In this case,
  all access to catalogs is allowed. ({issue}`5039`)
* Change file-based system and catalog access controls to only show catalogs, schemas, and tables a user
  has permissions on. ({issue}`5039`)
* Change file-based catalog access control to deny permissions inspection and manipulation. ({issue}`5039`)
* Add [file-based group provider](/security/group-mapping). ({issue}`5028`)

## Hive connector

* Add support for `hive.security=allow-all`, which allows to skip all authorization checks. ({issue}`5416`)
* Support Kerberos authentication for Hudi tables. ({issue}`5472`)
* Allow hiding Delta Lake tables from table listings such as `SHOW TABLES` or `information_schema.tables`,
  as these tables cannot be queried by the Hive connector. This be enabled using the `hive.hide-delta-lake-tables`
  configuration property. ({issue}`5430`)
* Improve query concurrency by listing data files more efficiently. ({issue}`5260`)
* Fix Parquet encoding for timestamps before 1970-01-01. ({issue}`5364`)

## Kafka connector

* Expose message timestamp via `_timestamp` internal column. ({issue}`4805`)
* Add predicate pushdown for `_timestamp`, `_partition_offset` and `_partition_id` columns. ({issue}`4805`)

## Phoenix connector

* Fix query failure when a column name in `CREATE TABLE` requires quoting. ({issue}`3601`)

## PostgreSQL connector

* Add support for setting a column comment. ({issue}`5307`)
* Add support for variable-precision `time` type. ({issue}`5342`)
* Allow `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE TABLE AS` with `timestamp` and `timestamp with time zone` with precision higher than 6.
  The resulting column will be declared with precision of 6, maximal supported by PostgreSQL. ({issue}`5342`)

## SQL Server connector

* Improve performance of queries with aggregations and `WHERE` clause. ({issue}`5327`)
