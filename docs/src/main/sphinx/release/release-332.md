## General

- Fix query failure during planning phase for certain queries involving multiple joins. ({issue}`3149`)
- Fix execution failure for queries involving large `IN` predicates on decimal values with precision larger than 18. ({issue}`3191`)
- Fix prepared statements or view creation for queries containing certain nested aliases or `TABLESAMPLE` clauses. ({issue}`3250`)
- Fix rare query failure. ({issue}`2981`)
- Ignore trailing whitespace when loading configuration files such as
  `etc/event-listener.properties` or `etc/group-provider.properties`.
  Trailing whitespace in `etc/config.properties` and catalog properties
  files was already ignored. ({issue}`3231`)
- Reduce overhead for internal communication requests. ({issue}`3215`)

  can be specified using the `event-listener.config-files` configuration property. ({issue}`3128`)
- Add `CREATE SCHEMA ... AUTHORIZATION` syntax to create a schema with specified owner. ({issue}`3066`).
- Add `optimizer.push-partial-aggregation-through-join` configuration property to control
  pushing partial aggregations through inner joins. Previously, this was only available
  via the `push_partial_aggregation_through_join` session property. ({issue}`3205`)
- Rename configuration property `optimizer.push-aggregation-through-join`
  to `optimizer.push-aggregation-through-outer-join`. ({issue}`3205`)
- Add operator statistics for the number of splits processed with a dynamic filter applied. ({issue}`3217`)

  unpartitioned tables would fail with a cryptic error. ({issue}`3366`)
- Add `hive.fs.new-directory-permissions` configuration property for setting the permissions of new directories
  created by Presto. Default value is `0777`, which corresponds to previous behavior. ({issue}`3126`)
- Add `hive.partition-use-column-names` configuration property and matching `partition_use_column_names` catalog
  session property that allows to match columns between table and partition schemas by names. By default they are mapped
  by index. ({issue}`2933`)
