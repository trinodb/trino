# Geospatial functions

Trino Geospatial functions that begin with the `ST_` prefix support the SQL/MM specification
and are compliant with the Open Geospatial Consortiumâ€™s (OGC) OpenGIS Specifications.
As such, many Trino Geospatial functions require, or more accurately, assume that
geometries that are operated on are both simple and valid. For example, it does not
make sense to calculate the area of a polygon that has a hole defined outside of the
polygon, or to construct a polygon from a non-simple boundary line.

Trino Geospatial functions support the Well-Known Text (WKT) and Well-Known Binary (WKB) form of spatial objects:

- `POINT (0 0)`
- `LINESTRING (0 0, 1 1, 1 2)`
- `POLYGON ((0 0, 4 0, 4 4, 0 4, 0 0), (1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))`
- `MULTIPOINT (0 0, 1 2)`
- `MULTILINESTRING ((0 0, 1 1, 1 2), (2 3, 3 2, 5 4))`
- `MULTIPOLYGON (((0 0, 4 0, 4 4, 0 4, 0 0), (1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1)), ((-1 -1, -1 -2, -2 -2, -2 -1, -1 -1)))`
- `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT(2 3), LINESTRING (2 3, 3 4))`

Use {func}`ST_GeometryFromText` and {func}`ST_GeomFromBinary` functions to create geometry
objects from WKT or WKB.

The `SphericalGeography` type provides native support for spatial features represented on
*geographic* coordinates (sometimes called *geodetic* coordinates, or *lat/lon*, or *lon/lat*).
Geographic coordinates are spherical coordinates expressed in angular units (degrees).

The basis for the `Geometry` type is a plane. The shortest path between two points on the plane is a
straight line. That means calculations on geometries (areas, distances, lengths, intersections, etc)
can be calculated using cartesian mathematics and straight line vectors.

The basis for the `SphericalGeography` type is a sphere. The shortest path between two points on the
sphere is a great circle arc. That means that calculations on geographies (areas, distances,
lengths, intersections, etc) must be calculated on the sphere, using more complicated mathematics.
More accurate measurements that take the actual spheroidal shape of the world into account are not
supported.

Values returned by the measurement functions {func}`ST_Distance` and {func}`ST_Length` are in the unit of meters;
values returned by {func}`ST_Area` are in square meters.

Use {func}`to_spherical_geography()` function to convert a geometry object to geography object.

For example, `ST_Distance(ST_Point(-71.0882, 42.3607), ST_Point(-74.1197, 40.6976))` returns
`3.4577` in the unit of the passed-in values on the euclidean plane, while
`ST_Distance(to_spherical_geography(ST_Point(-71.0882, 42.3607)), to_spherical_geography(ST_Point(-74.1197, 40.6976)))`
returns `312822.179` in meters.

`POLYGON`, `MULTIPOLYGON` geometries defined in 2D space, or `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` of such
geometries. For each point of the input geometry, it verifies that `point.x` is within
