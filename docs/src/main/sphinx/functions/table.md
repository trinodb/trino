# Table functions

A table function is a function returning a table. It can be invoked inside the
`FROM` clause of a query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(my_function(1, 100))
```

The row type of the returned table can depend on the arguments passed with
invocation of the function. If different row types can be returned, the
function is a **polymorphic table function**.

Polymorphic table functions allow you to dynamically invoke custom logic from
within the SQL query. They can be used for working with external systems as
well as for enhancing Trino with capabilities going beyond the SQL standard.

For the list of built-in table functions available in Trino, see [built-in
table functions](built-in-table-functions).

Trino supports adding custom table functions. They are declared by connectors
through implementing dedicated interfaces. For guidance on adding new table
functions, see the [developer guide](/develop/table-functions).

Connectors offer support for different functions on a per-connector basis. For
more information about supported table functions, refer to the [connector
documentation](/connector).

### `exclude_columns` table function

Use the `exclude_columns` table function to return a new table based on an input
table `table`, with the exclusion of all columns specified in `descriptor`:

:::{function} exclude_columns(input => table, columns => descriptor) -> table
:noindex: true

The argument `input` is a table or a query.
The argument `columns` is a descriptor without types.
:::

Example query using the orders table from the TPC-H dataset, provided by the
[](/connector/tpch):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(exclude_columns(
                        input => TABLE(orders),
                        columns => DESCRIPTOR(clerk, comment)));
```

The table function is useful for queries where you want to return nearly all
columns from tables with many columns. You can avoid enumerating all columns,
and only need to specify the columns to exclude.

(sequence-table-function)=
### `sequence` table function

Use the `sequence` table function to return a table with a single column
`sequential_number` containing a sequence of bigint:

:::{function} sequence(start => bigint, stop => bigint, step => bigint) -> table(sequential_number bigint)
:noindex: true

`start` is the first element in the sequence. The default value is `0`.

`stop` is the end of the range, inclusive. The last element in the
sequence is equal to `stop`, or it is the last value within range,
reachable by steps.

`step` is the difference between subsequent values. The default value is
`1`.
:::

Example query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(sequence(
                start => 1000000,
                stop => -2000000,
                step => -3));
```

The result of the `sequence` table function might not be ordered. If required,
enforce ordering in the enclosing query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(sequence(
                start => 0,
                stop => 100,
                step => 5))
ORDER BY sequential_number;
```

## Table function invocation

You invoke a table function in the `FROM` clause of a query. Table function
invocation syntax is similar to a scalar function call.

### Function resolution

Every table function is provided by a catalog, and it belongs to a schema in
the catalog. You can qualify the function name with a schema name, or with
catalog and schema names:

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(schema_name.my_function(1, 100))
SELECT * FROM TABLE(catalog_name.schema_name.my_function(1, 100))
```

Otherwise, the standard Trino name resolution is applied. The connection
between the function and the catalog must be identified, because the function
is executed by the corresponding connector. If the function is not registered
by the specified catalog, the query fails.

The table function name is resolved case-insensitive, analogically to scalar
function and table resolution in Trino.

### Arguments

There are three types of arguments.

1. Scalar arguments

They must be constant expressions, and they can be of any SQL type, which is
compatible with the declared argument type:

```
factor => 42
```

2. Descriptor arguments

Descriptors consist of fields with names and optional data types:

```
schema => DESCRIPTOR(id BIGINT, name VARCHAR)
columns => DESCRIPTOR(date, status, comment)
```

To pass `null` for a descriptor, use:

```
schema => CAST(null AS DESCRIPTOR)
```

3. Table arguments

You can pass a table name, or a query. Use the keyword `TABLE`:

```
input => TABLE(orders)
data => TABLE(SELECT * FROM region, nation WHERE region.regionkey = nation.regionkey)
```

If the table argument is declared as {ref}`set semantics<tf-set-or-row-semantics>`,
you can specify partitioning and ordering. Each partition is processed
independently by the table function. If you do not specify partitioning, the
argument is processed as a single partition. You can also specify
`PRUNE WHEN EMPTY` or `KEEP WHEN EMPTY`. With `PRUNE WHEN EMPTY` you
declare that you are not interested in the function result if the argument is
empty. This information is used by the Trino engine to optimize the query. The
`KEEP WHEN EMPTY` option indicates that the function should be executed even
if the table argument is empty. By specifying `KEEP WHEN EMPTY` or
`PRUNE WHEN EMPTY`, you override the property set for the argument by the
function author.

The following example shows how the table argument properties should be ordered:

```
input => TABLE(orders)
                    PARTITION BY orderstatus
                    KEEP WHEN EMPTY
                    ORDER BY orderdate
```

### Argument passing conventions

There are two conventions of passing arguments to a table function:

- **Arguments passed by name**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM TABLE(my_function(row_count => 100, column_count => 1))
  ```

In this convention, you can pass the arguments in arbitrary order. Arguments
declared with default values can be skipped. Argument names are resolved
case-sensitive, and with automatic uppercasing of unquoted names.

- **Arguments passed positionally**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM TABLE(my_function(1, 100))
  ```

In this convention, you must follow the order in which the arguments are
declared. You can skip a suffix of the argument list, provided that all the
skipped arguments are declared with default values.

You cannot mix the argument conventions in one invocation.

You can also use parameters in arguments:

```sql
PREPARE stmt FROM
SELECT * FROM TABLE(my_function(row_count => ? + 1, column_count => ?));

EXECUTE stmt USING 100, 1;
```
