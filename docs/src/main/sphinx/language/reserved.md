## Identifiers

Tokens that identify names of catalogs, schemas, tables, columns, functions, or
other objects, are identifiers.

Identifiers must start with a letter, and subsequently include alphanumeric
characters and underscores. Identifiers with other characters must be delimited
with double quotes (`"`). When delimited with double quotes, identifiers can use
any character. Escape a `"` with another preceding double quote in a delimited
identifier.

Identifiers are not treated as case sensitive.

Following are some valid examples:

```sql
tablename
SchemaName
example_catalog.a_schema."table$partitions"
"identifierWith""double""quotes"
```

The following identifiers are invalid in Trino and must be quoted when used:

```text
table-name
123SchemaName
colum$name@field
```
