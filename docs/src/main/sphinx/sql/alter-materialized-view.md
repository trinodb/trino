# ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW

## Synopsis

```text
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW name SET PROPERTIES property_name = expression [, ...]
```

## Description

Change the name of an existing materialized view.

The optional `IF EXISTS` clause causes the error to be suppressed if the
materialized view does not exist. The error is not suppressed if the
materialized view does not exist, but a table or view with the given name
exists.

### SET PROPERTIES

The `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW SET PROPERTIES`  statement followed by some number
of `property_name` and `expression` pairs applies the specified properties
and values to a materialized view. Omitting an already-set property from this
statement leaves that property unchanged in the materialized view.

A property in a `SET PROPERTIES` statement can be set to `DEFAULT`, which
reverts its value back to the default in that materialized view.

Support for `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW SET PROPERTIES` varies between
connectors. Refer to the connector documentation for more details.

## Examples

Rename materialized view `people` to `users` in the current schema:

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW people RENAME TO users;
```

Rename materialized view `people` to `users`, if materialized view
`people` exists in the current catalog and schema:

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS people RENAME TO users;
```

Set view properties (`x = y`) in materialized view `people`:

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW people SET PROPERTIES x = 'y';
```

Set multiple view properties (`foo = 123` and `foo bar = 456`) in
materialized view `people`:

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW people SET PROPERTIES foo = 123, "foo bar" = 456;
```

Set view property `x` to its default value in materialized view `people`:

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW people SET PROPERTIES x = DEFAULT;
```
