(select-with-session)=
## WITH SESSION clause

The `WITH SESSION` clause allows you to [set session and catalog session
property values](/sql/set-session) applicable for the processing of the current
SELECT statement only. The defined values override any other configuration and
session property settings. Multiple properties are separated by commas.

The following example overrides the global configuration property
`query.max-execution-time` with the session property `query_max_execution_time`
to reduce the time to `2h`. It also overrides the catalog property
`iceberg.query-partition-filter-required` from the `example` catalog using
[](/connector/iceberg) setting the catalog session property
`query_partition_filter_required` to `true`:

```sql
WITH
  SESSION
    query_max_execution_time='2h',
    example.query_partition_filter_required=true
SELECT *
FROM example.default.thetable
LIMIT 100;
```

## WITH FUNCTION clause

The `WITH FUNCTION` clause allows you to define a list of [](udf-inline) that
are available for use in the rest of the query.

The following example declares and uses two inline UDFs:

```sql
WITH 
  FUNCTION hello(name varchar)
    RETURNS varchar
    RETURN format('Hello %s!', 'name'),
  FUNCTION bye(name varchar)
    RETURNS varchar
    RETURN format('Bye %s!', 'name')
SELECT hello('Finn') || ' and ' || bye('Joe');
-- Hello Finn! and Bye Joe!
```

Find further information about UDFs in general, inline UDFs, all supported
statements, and examples in [](/udf).

## WITH clause

The `WITH` clause defines named relations for use within a query.
It allows flattening nested queries or simplifying subqueries.
For example, the following queries are equivalent:

```
SELECT a, b
FROM (
  SELECT a, MAX(b) AS b FROM t GROUP BY a
) AS x;

WITH x AS (SELECT a, MAX(b) AS b FROM t GROUP BY a)
SELECT a, b FROM x;
```

This also works with multiple subqueries:

```
WITH
  t1 AS (SELECT a, MAX(b) AS b FROM x GROUP BY a),
  t2 AS (SELECT a, AVG(d) AS d FROM y GROUP BY a)
SELECT t1.*, t2.*
FROM t1
JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.a;
```

Additionally, the relations within a `WITH` clause can chain:

```
WITH
  x AS (SELECT a FROM t),
  y AS (SELECT a AS b FROM x),
  z AS (SELECT b AS c FROM y)
SELECT c FROM z;
```

:::{warning}
Currently, the SQL for the `WITH` clause will be inlined anywhere the named
relation is used. This means that if the relation is used more than once and the query
is non-deterministic, the results may be different each time.
:::

## WITH RECURSIVE clause

The `WITH RECURSIVE` clause is a variant of the `WITH` clause. It defines
a list of queries to process, including recursive processing of suitable
queries.

:::{warning}
This feature is experimental only. Proceed to use it only if you understand
potential query failures and the impact of the recursion processing on your
workload.
:::

A recursive `WITH`-query must be shaped as a `UNION` of two relations. The
first relation is called the *recursion base*, and the second relation is called
the *recursion step*. Trino supports recursive `WITH`-queries with a single
recursive reference to a `WITH`-query from within the query. The name `T` of
the query `T` can be mentioned once in the `FROM` clause of the recursion
step relation.

The following listing shows a simple example, that displays a commonly used
form of a single query in the list:

```text
WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    VALUES (1)
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 4
)
SELECT sum(n) FROM t;
```

In the preceding query the simple assignment `VALUES (1)` defines the
recursion base relation. `SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 4` defines the
recursion step relation. The recursion processing performs these steps:

- recursive base yields `1`
- first recursion yields `1 + 1 = 2`
- second recursion uses the result from the first and adds one: `2 + 1 = 3`
- third recursion uses the result from the second and adds one again:
  `3 + 1 = 4`
- fourth recursion aborts since `n = 4`
- this results in `t` having values `1`, `2`, `3` and `4`
- the final statement performs the sum operation of these elements with the
  final result value `10`

The types of the returned columns are those of the base relation. Therefore it
is required that types in the step relation can be coerced to base relation
types.

The `RECURSIVE` clause applies to all queries in the `WITH` list, but not
all of them must be recursive. If a `WITH`-query is not shaped according to
the rules mentioned above or it does not contain a recursive reference, it is
processed like a regular `WITH`-query. Column aliases are mandatory for all
the queries in the recursive `WITH` list.

The following limitations apply as a result of following the SQL standard and
due to implementation choices, in addition to `WITH` clause limitations:

- only single-element recursive cycles are supported. Like in regular
  `WITH`-queries, references to previous queries in the `WITH` list are
  allowed. References to following queries are forbidden.
- usage of outer joins, set operations, limit clause, and others is not always
  allowed in the step relation
- recursion depth is fixed, defaults to `10`, and doesn't depend on the actual
  query results

You can adjust the recursion depth with the {doc}`session property
</sql/set-session>` `max_recursion_depth`. When changing the value consider
that the size of the query plan growth is quadratic with the recursion depth.

## SELECT clause

The `SELECT` clause specifies the output of the query. Each `select_expression`
defines a column or columns to be included in the result.

```text
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select_expression [, ...]
```

The `ALL` and `DISTINCT` quantifiers determine whether duplicate rows
are included in the result set. If the argument `ALL` is specified,
all rows are included. If the argument `DISTINCT` is specified, only unique
rows are included in the result set. In this case, each output column must
be of a type that allows comparison. If neither argument is specified,
the behavior defaults to `ALL`.

### Select expressions

Each `select_expression` must be in one of the following forms:

```text
expression [ [ AS ] column_alias ]
```

```text
row_expression.* [ AS ( column_alias [, ...] ) ]
```

```text
relation.*
```

```text
*
```

In the case of `expression [ [ AS ] column_alias ]`, a single output column
is defined.

In the case of `row_expression.* [ AS ( column_alias [, ...] ) ]`,
the `row_expression` is an arbitrary expression of type `ROW`.
All fields of the row define output columns to be included in the result set.

In the case of `relation.*`, all columns of `relation` are included
in the result set. In this case column aliases are not allowed.

In the case of `*`, all columns of the relation defined by the query
are included in the result set.

In the result set, the order of columns is the same as the order of their
specification by the select expressions. If a select expression returns multiple
columns, they are ordered the same way they were ordered in the source
relation or row type expression.

If column aliases are specified, they override any preexisting column
or row field names:

```
SELECT (CAST(ROW(1, true) AS ROW(field1 bigint, field2 boolean))).* AS (alias1, alias2);
```

```text
 alias1 | alias2
--------+--------
      1 | true
(1 row)
```

Otherwise, the existing names are used:

```
SELECT (CAST(ROW(1, true) AS ROW(field1 bigint, field2 boolean))).*;
```

```text
 field1 | field2
--------+--------
      1 | true
(1 row)
```

and in their absence, anonymous columns are produced:

```
SELECT (ROW(1, true)).*;
```

```text
 _col0 | _col1
-------+-------
     1 | true
(1 row)
```

## GROUP BY clause

The `GROUP BY` clause divides the output of a `SELECT` statement into
groups of rows containing matching values. A simple `GROUP BY` clause may
contain any expression composed of input columns or it may be an ordinal
number selecting an output column by position (starting at one).

The following queries are equivalent. They both group the output by
the `nationkey` input column with the first query using the ordinal
position of the output column and the second query using the input
column name:

```
SELECT count(*), nationkey FROM customer GROUP BY 2;

SELECT count(*), nationkey FROM customer GROUP BY nationkey;
```

`GROUP BY` clauses can group output by input column names not appearing in
the output of a select statement. For example, the following query generates
row counts for the `customer` table using the input column `mktsegment`:

```
SELECT count(*) FROM customer GROUP BY mktsegment;
```

```text
 _col0
-------
 29968
 30142
 30189
 29949
 29752
(5 rows)
```

When a `GROUP BY` clause is used in a `SELECT` statement all output
expressions must be either aggregate functions or columns present in
the `GROUP BY` clause.

(complex-grouping-operations)=
### Complex grouping operations

Trino also supports complex aggregations using the `GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`
and `ROLLUP` syntax. This syntax allows users to perform analysis that requires
aggregation on multiple sets of columns in a single query. Complex grouping
operations do not support grouping on expressions composed of input columns.
Only column names are allowed.

Complex grouping operations are often equivalent to a `UNION ALL` of simple
`GROUP BY` expressions, as shown in the following examples. This equivalence
does not apply, however, when the source of data for the aggregation
is non-deterministic.

### GROUPING SETS

Grouping sets allow users to specify multiple lists of columns to group on.
The columns not part of a given sublist of grouping columns are set to `NULL`.

```
SELECT * FROM shipping;
```

```text
 origin_state | origin_zip | destination_state | destination_zip | package_weight
--------------+------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------
 California   |      94131 | New Jersey        |            8648 |             13
 California   |      94131 | New Jersey        |            8540 |             42
 New Jersey   |       7081 | Connecticut       |            6708 |            225
 California   |      90210 | Connecticut       |            6927 |           1337
 California   |      94131 | Colorado          |           80302 |              5
 New York     |      10002 | New Jersey        |            8540 |              3
(6 rows)
```

`GROUPING SETS` semantics are demonstrated by this example query:

```
SELECT origin_state, origin_zip, destination_state, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (origin_state),
    (origin_state, origin_zip),
    (destination_state));
```

```text
 origin_state | origin_zip | destination_state | _col0
--------------+------------+-------------------+-------
 New Jersey   | NULL       | NULL              |   225
 California   | NULL       | NULL              |  1397
 New York     | NULL       | NULL              |     3
 California   |      90210 | NULL              |  1337
 California   |      94131 | NULL              |    60
 New Jersey   |       7081 | NULL              |   225
 New York     |      10002 | NULL              |     3
 NULL         | NULL       | Colorado          |     5
 NULL         | NULL       | New Jersey        |    58
 NULL         | NULL       | Connecticut       |  1562
(10 rows)
```

The preceding query may be considered logically equivalent to a `UNION ALL` of
multiple `GROUP BY` queries:

```
SELECT origin_state, NULL, NULL, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping GROUP BY origin_state

UNION ALL

SELECT origin_state, origin_zip, NULL, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping GROUP BY origin_state, origin_zip

UNION ALL

SELECT NULL, NULL, destination_state, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping GROUP BY destination_state;
```

However, the query with the complex grouping syntax (`GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`
or `ROLLUP`) will only read from the underlying data source once, while the
query with the `UNION ALL` reads the underlying data three times. This is why
queries with a `UNION ALL` may produce inconsistent results when the data
source is not deterministic.

### CUBE

The `CUBE` operator generates all possible grouping sets (i.e. a power set)
for a given set of columns. For example, the query:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY CUBE (origin_state, destination_state);
```

is equivalent to:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (origin_state, destination_state),
    (origin_state),
    (destination_state),
    ()
);
```

```text
 origin_state | destination_state | _col0
--------------+-------------------+-------
 California   | New Jersey        |    55
 California   | Colorado          |     5
 New York     | New Jersey        |     3
 New Jersey   | Connecticut       |   225
 California   | Connecticut       |  1337
 California   | NULL              |  1397
 New York     | NULL              |     3
 New Jersey   | NULL              |   225
 NULL         | New Jersey        |    58
 NULL         | Connecticut       |  1562
 NULL         | Colorado          |     5
 NULL         | NULL              |  1625
(12 rows)
```

### ROLLUP

The `ROLLUP` operator generates all possible subtotals for a given set of
columns. For example, the query:

```
SELECT origin_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY ROLLUP (origin_state, origin_zip);
```

```text
 origin_state | origin_zip | _col2
--------------+------------+-------
 California   |      94131 |    60
 California   |      90210 |  1337
 New Jersey   |       7081 |   225
 New York     |      10002 |     3
 California   | NULL       |  1397
 New York     | NULL       |     3
 New Jersey   | NULL       |   225
 NULL         | NULL       |  1625
(8 rows)
```

is equivalent to:

```
SELECT origin_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((origin_state, origin_zip), (origin_state), ());
```

### Combining multiple grouping expressions

Multiple grouping expressions in the same query are interpreted as having
cross-product semantics. For example, the following query:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS ((origin_state, destination_state)),
    ROLLUP (origin_zip);
```

which can be rewritten as:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS ((origin_state, destination_state)),
    GROUPING SETS ((origin_zip), ());
```

is logically equivalent to:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, destination_state)
);
```

```text
 origin_state | destination_state | origin_zip | _col3
--------------+-------------------+------------+-------
 New York     | New Jersey        |      10002 |     3
 California   | New Jersey        |      94131 |    55
 New Jersey   | Connecticut       |       7081 |   225
 California   | Connecticut       |      90210 |  1337
 California   | Colorado          |      94131 |     5
 New York     | New Jersey        | NULL       |     3
 New Jersey   | Connecticut       | NULL       |   225
 California   | Colorado          | NULL       |     5
 California   | Connecticut       | NULL       |  1337
 California   | New Jersey        | NULL       |    55
(10 rows)
```

The `ALL` and `DISTINCT` quantifiers determine whether duplicate grouping
sets each produce distinct output rows. This is particularly useful when
multiple complex grouping sets are combined in the same query. For example, the
following query:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY ALL
    CUBE (origin_state, destination_state),
    ROLLUP (origin_state, origin_zip);
```

is equivalent to:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, destination_state),
    (origin_state),
    (origin_state, destination_state),
    (origin_state),
    (origin_state, destination_state),
    (origin_state),
    (destination_state),
    ()
);
```

However, if the query uses the `DISTINCT` quantifier for the `GROUP BY`:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY DISTINCT
    CUBE (origin_state, destination_state),
    ROLLUP (origin_state, origin_zip);
```

only unique grouping sets are generated:

```
SELECT origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip, sum(package_weight)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (origin_state, destination_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, origin_zip),
    (origin_state, destination_state),
    (origin_state),
    (destination_state),
    ()
);
```

The default set quantifier is `ALL`.

### GROUPING operation

`grouping(col1, ..., colN) -> bigint`

The grouping operation returns a bit set converted to decimal, indicating which columns are present in a
grouping. It must be used in conjunction with `GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`  or `GROUP BY`
and its arguments must match exactly the columns referenced in the corresponding `GROUPING SETS`,
`ROLLUP`, `CUBE` or `GROUP BY` clause.

To compute the resulting bit set for a particular row, bits are assigned to the argument columns with
the rightmost column being the least significant bit. For a given grouping, a bit is set to 0 if the
corresponding column is included in the grouping and to 1 otherwise. For example, consider the query
below:

```
SELECT origin_state, origin_zip, destination_state, sum(package_weight),
       grouping(origin_state, origin_zip, destination_state)
FROM shipping
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (origin_state),
    (origin_state, origin_zip),
    (destination_state)
);
```

```text
origin_state | origin_zip | destination_state | _col3 | _col4
--------------+------------+-------------------+-------+-------
California   | NULL       | NULL              |  1397 |     3
New Jersey   | NULL       | NULL              |   225 |     3
New York     | NULL       | NULL              |     3 |     3
California   |      94131 | NULL              |    60 |     1
New Jersey   |       7081 | NULL              |   225 |     1
California   |      90210 | NULL              |  1337 |     1
New York     |      10002 | NULL              |     3 |     1
NULL         | NULL       | New Jersey        |    58 |     6
NULL         | NULL       | Connecticut       |  1562 |     6
NULL         | NULL       | Colorado          |     5 |     6
(10 rows)
```

The first grouping in the above result only includes the `origin_state` column and excludes
the `origin_zip` and `destination_state` columns. The bit set constructed for that grouping
is `011` where the most significant bit represents `origin_state`.

## HAVING clause

The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with aggregate functions and
the `GROUP BY` clause to control which groups are selected. A `HAVING`
clause eliminates groups that do not satisfy the given conditions.
`HAVING` filters groups after groups and aggregates are computed.

The following example queries the `customer` table and selects groups
with an account balance greater than the specified value:

```
SELECT count(*), mktsegment, nationkey,
       CAST(sum(acctbal) AS bigint) AS totalbal
FROM customer
GROUP BY mktsegment, nationkey
HAVING sum(acctbal) > 5700000
ORDER BY totalbal DESC;
```

```text
 _col0 | mktsegment | nationkey | totalbal

(7 rows)
```

(window-clause)=
## WINDOW clause

The `WINDOW` clause is used to define named window specifications. The defined named
window specifications can be referred to in the `SELECT` and `ORDER BY` clauses
of the enclosing query:

```
SELECT orderkey, clerk, totalprice,
      rank() OVER w AS rnk
FROM orders
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY clerk ORDER BY totalprice DESC)
ORDER BY count() OVER w, clerk, rnk
```

The window definition list of `WINDOW` clause can contain one or multiple named window
specifications of the form

```none
window_name AS (window_specification)
```

A window specification has the following components:

- The existing window name, which refers to a named window specification in the
  `WINDOW` clause. The window specification associated with the referenced name
  is the basis of the current specification.
- The partition specification, which separates the input rows into different
  partitions. This is analogous to how the `GROUP BY` clause separates rows
  into different groups for aggregate functions.
- The ordering specification, which determines the order in which input rows
  will be processed by the window function.
- The window frame, which specifies a sliding window of rows to be processed
  by the function for a given row. If the frame is not specified, it defaults
  to `RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`, which is the same as
  `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`. This frame contains all
  rows from the start of the partition up to the last peer of the current row.
  In the absence of `ORDER BY`, all rows are considered peers, so `RANGE
  BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` is equivalent to `BETWEEN
  UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`. The window frame syntax
  supports additional clauses for row pattern recognition. If the row pattern
  recognition clauses are specified, the window frame for a particular row
  consists of the rows matched by a pattern starting from that row.
  Additionally, if the frame specifies row pattern measures, they can be
  called over the window, similarly to window functions. For more details, see
  [Row pattern recognition in window structures](/sql/pattern-recognition-in-window) .

Each window component is optional. If a window specification does not specify
window partitioning, ordering or frame, those components are obtained from
the window specification referenced by the `existing window name`, or from
another window specification in the reference chain. In case when there is no
`existing window name` specified, or none of the referenced window
specifications contains the component, the default value is used.

## Set operations

`UNION`  `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` are all set operations.  These clauses are used
to combine the results of more than one select statement into a single result set:

```text
query UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] query
```

```text
query INTERSECT [ALL | DISTINCT] query
```

```text
query EXCEPT [ALL | DISTINCT] query
```

The argument `ALL` or `DISTINCT` controls which rows are included in
the final result set. If the argument `ALL` is specified all rows are
included even if the rows are identical.  If the argument `DISTINCT`
is specified only unique rows are included in the combined result set.
If neither is specified, the behavior defaults to `DISTINCT`.

Multiple set operations are processed left to right, unless the order is explicitly
specified via parentheses. Additionally, `INTERSECT` binds more tightly
than `EXCEPT` and `UNION`. That means `A UNION B INTERSECT C EXCEPT D`
is the same as `A UNION (B INTERSECT C) EXCEPT D`.

### UNION clause

`UNION` combines all the rows that are in the result set from the
first query with those that are in the result set for the second query.
The following is an example of one of the simplest possible `UNION` clauses.
It selects the value `13` and combines this result set with a second query
that selects the value `42`:

```
SELECT 13
UNION
SELECT 42;
```

```text
 _col0
-------
    13
    42
(2 rows)
```

The following query demonstrates the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.
It selects the value `13` and combines this result set with a second query that
selects the values `42` and `13`:

```
SELECT 13
UNION
SELECT * FROM (VALUES 42, 13);
```

```text
 _col0
-------
    13
    42
(2 rows)
```

```
SELECT 13
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM (VALUES 42, 13);
```

```text
 _col0
-------
    13
    42
    13
(2 rows)
```

### INTERSECT clause

`INTERSECT` returns only the rows that are in the result sets of both the first and
the second queries. The following is an example of one of the simplest
possible `INTERSECT` clauses. It selects the values `13` and `42` and combines
this result set with a second query that selects the value `13`.  Since `42`
is only in the result set of the first query, it is not included in the final results.:

```
SELECT * FROM (VALUES 13, 42)
INTERSECT
SELECT 13;
```

```text
 _col0
-------
    13
(2 rows)
```

### EXCEPT clause

`EXCEPT` returns the rows that are in the result set of the first query,
but not the second. The following is an example of one of the simplest
possible `EXCEPT` clauses. It selects the values `13` and `42` and combines
this result set with a second query that selects the value `13`.  Since `13`
is also in the result set of the second query, it is not included in the final result.:

```
SELECT * FROM (VALUES 13, 42)
EXCEPT
SELECT 13;
```

```text
 _col0
-------
   42
(2 rows)
```

(order-by-clause)=
## ORDER BY clause

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort a result set by one or more
output expressions:

```text
ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...]
```

Each expression may be composed of output columns, or it may be an ordinal
number selecting an output column by position, starting at one. The
`ORDER BY` clause is evaluated after any `GROUP BY` or `HAVING` clause,
and before any `OFFSET`, `LIMIT` or `FETCH FIRST` clause.
The default null ordering is `NULLS LAST`, regardless of the ordering direction.

Note that, following the SQL specification, an `ORDER BY` clause only
affects the order of rows for queries that immediately contain the clause.
Trino follows that specification, and drops redundant usage of the clause to
avoid negative performance impacts.

In the following example, the clause only applies to the select statement.

```SQL
INSERT INTO some_table
SELECT * FROM another_table
ORDER BY field;
```

Since tables in SQL are inherently unordered, and the `ORDER BY` clause in
this case does not result in any difference, but negatively impacts performance
of running the overall insert statement, Trino skips the sort operation.

Another example where the `ORDER BY` clause is redundant, and does not affect
the outcome of the overall statement, is a nested query:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM some_table
    JOIN (SELECT * FROM another_table ORDER BY field) u
    ON some_table.key = u.key;
```

More background information and details can be found in
[a blog post about this optimization](https://trino.io/blog/2019/06/03/redundant-order-by.html).

(offset-clause)=
## OFFSET clause

The `OFFSET` clause is used to discard a number of leading rows
from the result set:

```text
OFFSET count [ ROW | ROWS ]
```

If the `ORDER BY` clause is present, the `OFFSET` clause is evaluated
over a sorted result set, and the set remains sorted after the
leading rows are discarded:

```
SELECT name FROM nation ORDER BY name OFFSET 22;
```

```text
      name
----------------
 UNITED KINGDOM
 UNITED STATES
 VIETNAM
(3 rows)
```

Otherwise, it is arbitrary which rows are discarded.
If the count specified in the `OFFSET` clause equals or exceeds the size
of the result set, the final result is empty.

(limit-clause)=
## LIMIT or FETCH FIRST clause

The `LIMIT` or `FETCH FIRST` clause restricts the number of rows
in the result set.

```text
LIMIT { count | ALL }
```

```text
FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } { ONLY | WITH TIES }
```

The following example queries a large table, but the `LIMIT` clause
restricts the output to only have five rows (because the query lacks an `ORDER BY`,
exactly which rows are returned is arbitrary):

```
SELECT orderdate FROM orders LIMIT 5;
```

```text
 orderdate
------------
 1994-07-25
 1993-11-12
 1992-10-06
 1994-01-04
 1997-12-28
(5 rows)
```

`LIMIT ALL` is the same as omitting the `LIMIT` clause.

The `FETCH FIRST` clause supports either the `FIRST` or `NEXT` keywords
and the `ROW` or `ROWS` keywords. These keywords are equivalent and
the choice of keyword has no effect on query execution.

If the count is not specified in the `FETCH FIRST` clause, it defaults to `1`:

```
SELECT orderdate FROM orders FETCH FIRST ROW ONLY;
```

```text
 orderdate
------------
 1994-02-12
(1 row)
```

If the `OFFSET` clause is present, the `LIMIT` or `FETCH FIRST` clause
is evaluated after the `OFFSET` clause:

```
SELECT * FROM (VALUES 5, 2, 4, 1, 3) t(x) ORDER BY x OFFSET 2 LIMIT 2;
```

```text
 x
---
 3
 4
(2 rows)
```

For the `FETCH FIRST` clause, the argument `ONLY` or `WITH TIES`
controls which rows are included in the result set.

If the argument `ONLY` is specified, the result set is limited to the exact
number of leading rows determined by the count.

If the argument `WITH TIES` is specified, it is required that the `ORDER BY`
clause be present. The result set consists of the same set of leading rows
and all of the rows in the same peer group as the last of them ('ties')
as established by the ordering in the `ORDER BY` clause. The result set is sorted:

```
SELECT name, regionkey
FROM nation
ORDER BY regionkey FETCH FIRST ROW WITH TIES;
```

```text
    name    | regionkey
------------+-----------
 ETHIOPIA   |         0
 MOROCCO    |         0
 KENYA      |         0
 ALGERIA    |         0
 MOZAMBIQUE |         0
(5 rows)
```

(tablesample)=
## TABLESAMPLE

There are multiple sample methods:

`BERNOULLI`

: Each row is selected to be in the table sample with a probability of
  the sample percentage. When a table is sampled using the Bernoulli
  method, all physical blocks of the table are scanned and certain
  rows are skipped (based on a comparison between the sample percentage
  and a random value calculated at runtime).

  The probability of a row being included in the result is independent
  from any other row. This does not reduce the time required to read
  the sampled table from disk. It may have an impact on the total
  query time if the sampled output is processed further.

`SYSTEM`

: This sampling method divides the table into logical segments of data
  and samples the table at this granularity. This sampling method either
  selects all the rows from a particular segment of data or skips it
  (based on a comparison between the sample percentage and a random
  value calculated at runtime).

  The rows selected in a system sampling will be dependent on which
  connector is used. For example, when used with Hive, it is dependent
  on how the data is laid out on HDFS. This method does not guarantee
  independent sampling probabilities.

:::{note}
Neither of the two methods allow deterministic bounds on the number of rows returned.
:::

Examples:

```
SELECT *
FROM users TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (50);

SELECT *
FROM users TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (75);
```

Using sampling with joins:

```
SELECT o.*, i.*
FROM orders o TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (10)
JOIN lineitem i TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (40)
  ON o.orderkey = i.orderkey;
```

(unnest)=
## UNNEST

`UNNEST` can be used to expand an {ref}`array-type` or {ref}`map-type` into a relation.
Arrays are expanded into a single column:

```
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY[1,2]) AS t(number);
```

```text
 number
--------
      1
      2
(2 rows)
```

Maps are expanded into two columns (key, value):

```
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(
        map_from_entries(
            ARRAY[
                ('SQL',1974),
                ('Java', 1995)
            ]
        )
) AS t(language, first_appeared_year);
```

```text
 language | first_appeared_year
----------+---------------------
 SQL      |                1974
 Java     |                1995
(2 rows)
```

`UNNEST` can be used in combination with an `ARRAY` of {ref}`row-type` structures for expanding each
field of the `ROW` into a corresponding column:

```
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(
        ARRAY[
            ROW('Java',  1995),
            ROW('SQL' , 1974)],
        ARRAY[
            ROW(false),
            ROW(true)]
) as t(language,first_appeared_year,declarative);
```

```text
 language | first_appeared_year | declarative
----------+---------------------+-------------
 Java     |                1995 | false
 SQL      |                1974 | true
(2 rows)
```

`UNNEST` can optionally have a `WITH ORDINALITY` clause, in which case an additional ordinality column
is added to the end:

```
SELECT a, b, rownumber
FROM UNNEST (
    ARRAY[2, 5],
    ARRAY[7, 8, 9]
     ) WITH ORDINALITY AS t(a, b, rownumber);
```

```text
  a   | b | rownumber
------+---+-----------
    2 | 7 |         1
    5 | 8 |         2
 NULL | 9 |         3
(3 rows)
```

`UNNEST` returns zero entries when the array/map is empty:

```
SELECT * FROM UNNEST (ARRAY[]) AS t(value);
```

```text
 value
-------
(0 rows)
```

`UNNEST` returns zero entries when the array/map is null:

```
SELECT * FROM UNNEST (CAST(null AS ARRAY(integer))) AS t(number);
```

```text
 number
--------
(0 rows)
```

`UNNEST` is normally used with a `JOIN`, and can reference columns
from relations on the left side of the join:

```
SELECT student, score
FROM (
   VALUES
      ('John', ARRAY[7, 10, 9]),
      ('Mary', ARRAY[4, 8, 9])
) AS tests (student, scores)
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(scores) AS t(score);
```

```text
 student | score
---------+-------
 John    |     7
 John    |    10
 John    |     9
 Mary    |     4
 Mary    |     8
 Mary    |     9
(6 rows)
```

`UNNEST` can also be used with multiple arguments, in which case they are expanded into multiple columns,
with as many rows as the highest cardinality argument (the other columns are padded with nulls):

```
SELECT numbers, animals, n, a
FROM (
  VALUES
    (ARRAY[2, 5], ARRAY['dog', 'cat', 'bird']),
    (ARRAY[7, 8, 9], ARRAY['cow', 'pig'])
) AS x (numbers, animals)
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(numbers, animals) AS t (n, a);
```

```text
  numbers  |     animals      |  n   |  a
-----------+------------------+------+------
 [2, 5]    | [dog, cat, bird] |    2 | dog
 [2, 5]    | [dog, cat, bird] |    5 | cat
 [2, 5]    | [dog, cat, bird] | NULL | bird
 [7, 8, 9] | [cow, pig]       |    7 | cow
 [7, 8, 9] | [cow, pig]       |    8 | pig
 [7, 8, 9] | [cow, pig]       |    9 | NULL
(6 rows)
```

`LEFT JOIN` is preferable in order to avoid losing the row containing the array/map field in question
when referenced columns from relations on the left side of the join can be empty or have `NULL` values:

```
SELECT runner, checkpoint
FROM (
   VALUES
      ('Joe', ARRAY[10, 20, 30, 42]),
      ('Roger', ARRAY[10]),
      ('Dave', ARRAY[]),
      ('Levi', NULL)
) AS marathon (runner, checkpoints)
LEFT JOIN UNNEST(checkpoints) AS t(checkpoint) ON TRUE;
```

```text
 runner | checkpoint
--------+------------
 Joe    |         10
 Joe    |         20
 Joe    |         30
 Joe    |         42
 Roger  |         10
 Dave   |       NULL
 Levi   |       NULL
(7 rows)
```

Note that in case of using `LEFT JOIN` the only condition supported by the current implementation is `ON TRUE`.

(select-json-table)=
## JSON_TABLE

`JSON_TABLE` transforms JSON data into a relational table format. Like `UNNEST`
and `LATERAL`, use `JSON_TABLE` in the `FROM` clause of a `SELECT` statement.
For more information, see [`JSON_TABLE`](json-table).

## Joins

Joins allow you to combine data from multiple relations.

### CROSS JOIN

A cross join returns the Cartesian product (all combinations) of two
relations. Cross joins can either be specified using the explit
`CROSS JOIN` syntax or by specifying multiple relations in the
`FROM` clause.

Both of the following queries are equivalent:

```
SELECT *
FROM nation
CROSS JOIN region;

SELECT *
FROM nation, region;
```

The `nation` table contains 25 rows and the `region` table contains 5 rows,
so a cross join between the two tables produces 125 rows:

```
SELECT n.name AS nation, r.name AS region
FROM nation AS n
CROSS JOIN region AS r
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

```text
     nation     |   region
----------------+-------------
 ALGERIA        | AFRICA
 ALGERIA        | AMERICA
 ALGERIA        | ASIA
 ALGERIA        | EUROPE
 ALGERIA        | MIDDLE EAST
 ARGENTINA      | AFRICA
 ARGENTINA      | AMERICA
...
(125 rows)
```

### LATERAL

Subqueries appearing in the `FROM` clause can be preceded by the keyword `LATERAL`.
This allows them to reference columns provided by preceding `FROM` items.

A `LATERAL` join can appear at the top level in the `FROM` list, or anywhere
within a parenthesized join tree. In the latter case, it can also refer to any items
that are on the left-hand side of a `JOIN` for which it is on the right-hand side.

When a `FROM` item contains `LATERAL` cross-references, evaluation proceeds as follows:
for each row of the `FROM` item providing the cross-referenced columns,
the `LATERAL` item is evaluated using that row set's values of the columns.
The resulting rows are joined as usual with the rows they were computed from.
This is repeated for set of rows from the column source tables.

`LATERAL` is primarily useful when the cross-referenced column is necessary for
computing the rows to be joined:

```
SELECT name, x, y
FROM nation
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (SELECT name || ' :-' AS x)
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (SELECT x || ')' AS y);
```

### Qualifying column names

When two relations in a join have columns with the same name, the column
references must be qualified using the relation alias (if the relation
has an alias), or with the relation name:

```
SELECT nation.name, region.name
FROM nation
CROSS JOIN region;

SELECT n.name, r.name
FROM nation AS n
CROSS JOIN region AS r;

SELECT n.name, r.name
FROM nation n
CROSS JOIN region r;
```

The following query will fail with the error `Column 'name' is ambiguous`:

```
SELECT name
FROM nation
CROSS JOIN region;
```

## Subqueries

A subquery is an expression which is composed of a query. The subquery
is correlated when it refers to columns outside of the subquery.
Logically, the subquery will be evaluated for each row in the surrounding
query. The referenced columns will thus be constant during any single
evaluation of the subquery.

:::{note}
Support for correlated subqueries is limited. Not every standard form is supported.
:::

### EXISTS

The `EXISTS` predicate determines if a subquery returns any rows:

```
SELECT name
FROM nation
WHERE EXISTS (
     SELECT *
     FROM region
     WHERE region.regionkey = nation.regionkey
);
```

### IN

The `IN` predicate determines if any values produced by the subquery
are equal to the provided expression. The result of `IN` follows the
standard rules for nulls. The subquery must produce exactly one column:

```
SELECT name
FROM nation
WHERE regionkey IN (
     SELECT regionkey
     FROM region
     WHERE name = 'AMERICA' OR name = 'AFRICA'
);
```

### Scalar subquery

A scalar subquery is a non-correlated subquery that returns zero or
one row. It is an error for the subquery to produce more than one
row. The returned value is `NULL` if the subquery produces no rows:

```
SELECT name
FROM nation
WHERE regionkey = (SELECT max(regionkey) FROM region);
```

:::{note}
Currently only single column can be returned from the scalar subquery.
