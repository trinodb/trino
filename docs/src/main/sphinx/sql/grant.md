# GRANT privilege

## Synopsis

```text
GRANT ( privilege [, ...] | ( ALL PRIVILEGES ) )
ON [ BRANCH branch_name IN ] ( table_name | TABLE table_name | SCHEMA schema_name)
TO ( user | USER user | ROLE role )
[ WITH GRANT OPTION ]
```

## Description

Grants the specified privileges to the specified grantee.

Specifying `ALL PRIVILEGES` grants {doc}`delete`, {doc}`insert`, {doc}`update` and {doc}`select` privileges.

Specifying `ROLE PUBLIC` grants privileges to the `PUBLIC` role and hence to all users.

The optional `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause allows the grantee to grant these same privileges to others.

For `GRANT` statement to succeed, the user executing it should possess the specified privileges as well as the `GRANT OPTION` for those privileges.

Grant on a table grants the specified privilege on all current and future columns of the table.

Grant on a schema grants the specified privilege on all current and future columns of all current and future tables of the schema.

## Examples

Grant `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on the table `orders` to user `alice`:

```
GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON orders TO alice;
```

Grant `DELETE` privilege on the schema `finance` to user `bob`:

```
GRANT DELETE ON SCHEMA finance TO bob;
```

Grant `SELECT` privilege on the table `nation` to user `alice`, additionally allowing `alice` to grant `SELECT` privilege to others:

```
GRANT SELECT ON nation TO alice WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Grant `SELECT` privilege on the table `orders` to everyone:

```
GRANT SELECT ON orders TO ROLE PUBLIC;
```

Grant `INSERT` privilege on the `audit` branch of the `orders` table to user 
`alice`:

```sql
GRANT INSERT ON BRANCH audit IN orders TO alice;
```

## Limitations

Some connectors have no support for `GRANT`.
