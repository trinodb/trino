SHOW STATS FOR table
SHOW STATS FOR ( query )

## Description

Returns approximated statistics for the named table or for the results of a

the table (identifiable by a `NULL` value for `column_name`). The following
table lists the returned columns and what statistics they represent. Any
additional statistics collected on the data source, other than those listed
here, are not included.
