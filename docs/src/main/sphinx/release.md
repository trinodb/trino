## Breaking changes

Starting with Trino 432, release notes include a ⚠️ symbol to highlight any
changes as potentially breaking changes. The following changes are considered
and may require adjustments:

* Removal or renaming of configuration properties that may prevent startup or
  require configuration changes
* Changes to default values for configuration properties that may significantly
  change the behavior of a system
* Updates to the requirements for external systems or software used with Trino,
  such as removal of support for an old version of a data source in a connector
* Non-backwards compatible changes to the SPI which may require plugins to be
  updated
* Otherwise significant changes that requires specific attention from teams
  managing a Trino deployment
