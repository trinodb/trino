### ALTER TABLE RENAME TO limitation

The connector does not support renaming tables across multiple schemas. For
example, the following statement is supported:

```sql
ALTER TABLE example.schema_one.table_one RENAME TO example.schema_one.table_two
```

The following statement attempts to rename a table across schemas, and therefore
is not supported:

```sql
ALTER TABLE example.schema_one.table_one RENAME TO example.schema_two.table_two
```
