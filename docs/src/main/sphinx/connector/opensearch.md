# OpenSearch connector

```{raw} html
<img src="../_static/img/opensearch.png" class="connector-logo">
```

The OpenSearch connector allows access to [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/)
data from Trino. This document describes how to configure a catalog with the
OpenSearch connector to run SQL queries against OpenSearch.

## Requirements

- OpenSearch 1.1.0 or higher.
- Network access from the Trino coordinator and workers to the OpenSearch nodes.

## Configuration

To configure the OpenSearch connector, create a catalog properties file
`etc/catalog/example.properties` with the following content, replacing the
properties as appropriate for your setup:

```text
connector.name=opensearch
opensearch.host=search.example.com
opensearch.port=9200
opensearch.default-schema-name=default
```

The following table details all general configuration properties:

:::{list-table} OpenSearch configuration properties
:widths: 35, 55, 10
:header-rows: 1

* - Property name
  - Description
  - Default
* - `opensearch.host`
  - The comma-separated list of host names of the OpenSearch cluster. This
    property is required.
  -
* - `opensearch.port`
  - Port to use to connect to OpenSearch.
  - `9200`
* - `opensearch.default-schema-name`
  - The schema that contains all tables defined without a qualifying schema
    name.
  - `default`
* - `opensearch.scroll-size`
  - Sets the maximum number of hits that can be returned with each [OpenSearch
    scroll request](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/scroll/).
  - `1000`
* - `opensearch.scroll-timeout`
  - [Duration](prop-type-duration) for OpenSearch to keep the search context
    alive for scroll requests.
  - `1m`
* - `opensearch.request-timeout`
  - Timeout [duration](prop-type-duration) for all OpenSearch requests.
  - `10s`
* - `opensearch.connect-timeout`

    attempts.
  - `1s`
* - `opensearch.backoff-init-delay`
  - The minimum [duration](prop-type-duration) between backpressure retry
    attempts for a single request to OpenSearch. Setting it too low can
    overwhelm an already struggling cluster.
  - `500ms`
* - `opensearch.backoff-max-delay`
  - The maximum [duration](prop-type-duration) between backpressure retry
    attempts for a single request.

### Authentication

The connection to OpenSearch can use AWS or password authentication.

To enable AWS authentication and authorization using IAM policies, the
`opensearch.security` option must be set to `AWS`. Additionally, the
following options must be configured:

:::{list-table}
:widths: 40, 60
:header-rows: 1

* - Property name
  - Description
* - `opensearch.aws.region`
  - AWS region of the OpenSearch endpoint. This option is required.
* - `opensearch.aws.access-key`
  - AWS access key to use to connect to the OpenSearch domain. If not set, the
    default AWS credentials provider chain is used.
* - `opensearch.aws.secret-key`
  - AWS secret key to use to connect to the OpenSearch domain. If not set, the
    default AWS credentials provider chain is used.
* - `opensearch.aws.iam-role`

  - Description
* - `opensearch.auth.user`
  - User name to use to connect to OpenSearch.
* - `opensearch.auth.password`
  - Password to use to connect to OpenSearch.
:::

### Connection security with TLS

The connector provides additional security options to connect to OpenSearch
clusters with TLS enabled.

If your cluster uses globally-trusted certificates, you only need to
enable TLS. If you require custom configuration for certificates, the connector
supports key stores and trust stores in P12 (PKCS) or Java Key Store (JKS) format.

The available configuration values are listed in the following table:

:::{list-table} TLS configuration properties
:widths: 40, 60
:header-rows: 1

* - Property name
  - Description
* - `opensearch.tls.enabled`
  - Enable TLS security. Defaults to `false`.
* - `opensearch.tls.keystore-path`
  - The path to the P12 (PKCS) or [JKS](/security/inspect-jks)
    key store.
* - `opensearch.tls.truststore-path`

(opensearch-type-mapping)=
## Type mapping

Because Trino and OpenSearch each support types that the other does not, the
connector [maps some types](type-mapping-overview) when reading data.

### OpenSearch type to Trino type mapping

The connector maps OpenSearch types to the corresponding Trino types
according to the following table:

:::{list-table} OpenSearch type to Trino type mapping
:widths: 30, 30, 50
:header-rows: 1

* - OpenSearch type
  - Trino type
  - Notes
* - `BOOLEAN`
  - `BOOLEAN`
  -
* - `DOUBLE`
  - `DOUBLE`
  -
* - `FLOAT`
  - `REAL`
  -
* - `BYTE`
  - `TINYINT`
  -
* - `SHORT`
  - `SMALLINT`
  -
* - `INTEGER`
  - `INTEGER`
  -
* - `LONG`
  - `BIGINT`
  -
* - `KEYWORD`
  - `VARCHAR`
  -
* - `TEXT`
  - `VARCHAR`
  -
* - `DATE`
  - `TIMESTAMP`
  - For more information, see [](opensearch-date-types).
* - `IPADDRESS`
  - `IP`
  -
:::

No other types are supported.

(opensearch-array-types)=
### Array types

Fields in OpenSearch can contain [zero or more
values](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/date/#custom-formats),
but there is no dedicated array type. To indicate a field contains an array, it
can be annotated in a Trino-specific structure in the
[\_meta](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/index/#get-a-mapping)
section of the index mapping in OpenSearch.

For example, you can have an OpenSearch index that contains documents with the
following structure:

```json
{
    "array_string_field": ["trino","the","lean","machine-ohs"],
    "long_field": 314159265359,
    "id_field": "564e6982-88ee-4498-aa98-df9e3f6b6109",
    "timestamp_field": "1987-09-17T06:22:48.000Z",
    "object_field": {
        "array_int_field": [86,75,309],
        "int_field": 2
    }
}
```

The array fields of this structure can be defined by using the following command
to add the field property definition to the `_meta.trino` property of the target
index mapping with OpenSearch available at `search.example.com:9200`:

```shell
curl --request PUT \
    --url search.example.com:9200/doc/_mapping \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "_meta": {
        "trino":{
            "array_string_field":{
                "isArray":true
            },
            "object_field":{
                "array_int_field":{
                    "isArray":true
                }
            },
        }
    }
}'
```

:::{note}
It is not allowed to use `asRawJson` and `isArray` flags simultaneously for the same column.
:::

(opensearch-date-types)=
### Date types

The OpenSearch connector supports only the default `date` type. All other
OpenSearch [date] formats including [built-in date formats] and [custom date
formats] are not supported. Dates with the [format] property are ignored.

### Raw JSON transform

Documents in OpenSearch can include more complex structures that are not
represented in the mapping. For example, a single `keyword` field can have
widely different content including a single `keyword` value, an array, or a
multidimensional `keyword` array with any level of nesting.

The following command configures `array_string_field` mapping with OpenSearch
available at `search.example.com:9200`:

```shell
curl --request PUT \
    --url search.example.com:9200/doc/_mapping \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "properties": {
        "array_string_field":{
            "type": "keyword"
        }
    }
}'
```

All the following documents are legal for OpenSearch with `array_string_field`
mapping:

```json
[
    {
        "array_string_field": "trino"
    },
    {
        "array_string_field": ["trino","is","the","best"]
    },
    {
        "array_string_field": ["trino",["is","the","best"]]
    },
    {
        "array_string_field": ["trino",["is",["the","best"]]]
    }
]
```

See the [OpenSearch array
documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/index/#arrays)
for more details.

Further, OpenSearch supports types, such as [k-NN
vector](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/knn-vector/),
that are not supported in Trino. These and other types can cause parsing
exceptions for users that use of these types in OpenSearch. To manage all of
these scenarios, you can transform fields to raw JSON by annotating it in a
Trino-specific structure in the
[\_meta](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/index/) section of the
OpenSearch index mapping. This indicates to Trino that the field, and all nested
fields beneath, must be cast to a `VARCHAR` field that contains the raw JSON
content. These fields can be defined by using the following command to add the
field property definition to the `_meta.trino` property of the target index
mapping.

```shell
curl --request PUT \
    --url search.example.com:9200/doc/_mapping \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
    "_meta": {
      "trino":{
        "array_string_field":{
            "asRawJson":true
        }
      }
    }
}'
```

The preceding configuration causes Trino to return the `array_string_field`
field as a `VARCHAR` containing raw JSON. You can parse these fields with the
[built-in JSON functions](/functions/json).

:::{note}
It is not allowed to use `asRawJson` and `isArray` flags simultaneously for the same column.

## Special columns

The following hidden columns are available:

:::{list-table}
:widths: 25, 75
:header-rows: 1

* - Column
  - Description
* - `_id`
  - The OpenSearch document ID.
* - `_score`
  - The document score returned by the OpenSearch query.
* - `_source`
  - The source of the original document.

(opensearch-sql-support)=
## SQL support

The connector provides [globally available](sql-globally-available) and
[read operation](sql-read-operations) statements to access data and
metadata in the OpenSearch catalog.

### Wildcard table

The connector provides support to query multiple tables using a concise
[wildcard table](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/multi-search/#metadata-only-options)
notation.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM example.web."page_views_*";
```

### Table functions

The connector provides specific [table functions](/functions/table) to
access OpenSearch.

(opensearch-raw-query-function)=
#### `raw_query(varchar) -> table`

The `raw_query` function allows you to query the underlying database directly
using the [OpenSearch Query
DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/index/) syntax. The full DSL
query is pushed down and processed in OpenSearch. This can be useful for
accessing native features which are not available in Trino, or for improving
query performance in situations where running a query natively may be faster.

```{include} query-passthrough-warning.fragment
```

The `raw_query` function requires three parameters:

- `schema`: The schema in the catalog that the query is to be executed on.
- `index`: The index in OpenSearch to search.
- `query`: The query to execute, written in [OpenSearch Query DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl).

Once executed, the query returns a single row containing the resulting JSON
payload returned by OpenSearch.

For example, query the `example` catalog and use the `raw_query` table function
to search for documents in the `orders` index where the country name is
`ALGERIA` as defined as a JSON-formatted query matcher and passed to the
`raw_query` table function in the `query` parameter:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  TABLE(
    example.system.raw_query(
      schema => 'sales',
      index => 'orders',
      query => '{
        "query": {
          "match": {
            "name": "ALGERIA"
          }
        }
      }'
    )
  );
```

```{include} query-table-function-ordering.fragment
```

## Performance

The connector includes a number of performance improvements, detailed in the
following sections.

### Parallel data access

The connector requests data from multiple nodes of the OpenSearch cluster for
query processing in parallel.

### Predicate push down

The connector supports [predicate push down](predicate-pushdown) for the
following data types:

:::{list-table}
:widths: 50, 50
:header-rows: 1

* - OpenSearch
  - Trino
* - `boolean`
  - `BOOLEAN`
* - `double`
  - `DOUBLE`
* - `float`
  - `REAL`
* - `byte`
  - `TINYINT`
* - `short`
  - `SMALLINT`
* - `integer`
  - `INTEGER`
* - `long`
  - `BIGINT`
* - `keyword`
  - `VARCHAR`
* - `date`
  - `TIMESTAMP`
:::

No other data types are supported for predicate push down.
