### Non-transactional MERGE

The connector supports adding, updating, and deleting rows using [MERGE
statements](/sql/merge), if the `merge.non-transactional-merge.enabled` catalog
property or the corresponding `non_transactional_merge_enabled` catalog session
property is set to `true`. Merge is only supported for directly modifying target
tables.

In rare cases, exceptions may occur during the merge operation, potentially
resulting in a partial update.
