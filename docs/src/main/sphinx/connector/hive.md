# Hive connector

```{raw} html
<img src="../_static/img/hive.png" class="connector-logo">
```

The Hive connector allows querying data stored in an
[Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)
data warehouse. Hive is a combination of three components:

- Data files in varying formats, that are typically stored in the
  Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or in object storage systems
  such as Amazon S3.
- Metadata about how the data files are mapped to schemas and tables. This
  metadata is stored in a database, such as MySQL, and is accessed via the Hive
  metastore service.
- A query language called HiveQL. This query language is executed on a
  distributed computing framework such as MapReduce or Tez.

Trino only uses the first two components: the data and the metadata.
It does not use HiveQL or any part of Hive's execution environment.

## Requirements

The Hive connector requires a
{ref}`Hive metastore service <hive-thrift-metastore>` (HMS), or a compatible
implementation of the Hive metastore, such as
{ref}`AWS Glue <hive-glue-metastore>`.

You must select and configure a [supported
file system](hive-file-system-configuration) in your catalog configuration file.

The coordinator and all workers must have network access to the Hive metastore
and the storage system. Hive metastore access with the Thrift protocol defaults
to using port 9083.

Data files must be in a supported file format. File formats can be
configured using the [`format` table property](hive-table-properties)
and other specific properties:

- {ref}`ORC <orc-format-configuration>`
- {ref}`Parquet <parquet-format-configuration>`
- Avro

In the case of serializable formats, only specific
[SerDes](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerDes) are allowed:

- RCText - RCFile using `ColumnarSerDe`
- RCBinary - RCFile using `LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe`
- SequenceFile
- CSV - using `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde`
- JSON - using `org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe`
- OPENX_JSON - OpenX JSON SerDe from `org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe`. Find
  more [details about the Trino implementation in the source repository](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/tree/master/lib/trino-hive-formats/src/main/java/io/trino/hive/formats/line/openxjson/README.md).
- TextFile

(hive-configuration)=
## General configuration

To configure the Hive connector, create a catalog properties file
`etc/catalog/example.properties` that references the `hive` connector.

You must configure a [metastore for metadata](/object-storage/metastores).

You must select and configure one of the [supported file
systems](hive-file-system-configuration).


```properties
connector.name=hive
hive.metastore.uri=thrift://example.net:9083
fs.x.enabled=true
```

Replace the `fs.x.enabled` configuration property with the desired file system.

If you are using {ref}`AWS Glue <hive-glue-metastore>` as your metastore, you
must instead set `hive.metastore` to `glue`:

```properties
connector.name=hive
hive.metastore=glue
```

Each metastore type has specific configuration properties along with
[](general-metastore-properties).

### Multiple Hive clusters

You can have as many catalogs as you need, so if you have additional
Hive clusters, simply add another properties file to `etc/catalog`
with a different name, making sure it ends in `.properties`. For
example, if you name the property file `sales.properties`, Trino
creates a catalog named `sales` using the configured connector.

(hive-configuration-properties)=
### Hive general configuration properties

The following table lists general configuration properties for the Hive
connector. There are additional sets of configuration properties throughout the
Hive connector documentation.

:::{list-table} Hive general configuration properties
:widths: 35, 50, 15
:header-rows: 1

* - Property Name
  - Description
  - Default

* - `hive.recursive-directories`
  - Enable reading data from subdirectories of table or partition locations. If
    disabled, subdirectories are ignored. This is equivalent to the
    `hive.mapred.supports.subdirectories` property in Hive.
  - `false`
* - `hive.ignore-absent-partitions`
  - Ignore partitions when the file system location does not exist rather than
    failing the query. This skips data that may be expected to be part of the

    session property is `orc_use_column_names`. See also,
    [](orc-format-configuration)
  - `false`
* - `hive.parquet.use-column-names`
  - Access Parquet columns by name by default. Set this property to `false` to
    access columns by their ordinal position in the Hive table definition. The
    equivalent catalog session property is `parquet_use_column_names`. See also,

  - `true`
* - `hive.parquet.time-zone`
  - Time zone for Parquet read and write.
  - JVM default
* - `hive.compression-codec`

  - Should new partitions be written using the existing table format or the
    default Trino format?
  - `true`
* - `hive.immutable-partitions`
  - Can new data be inserted into existing partitions? If `true` then setting
    `hive.insert-existing-partitions-behavior` to `APPEND` is not allowed. This
    also affects the `insert_existing_partitions_behavior` session property in
    the same way.
  - `false`
* - `hive.insert-existing-partitions-behavior`
  - What happens when data is inserted into an existing partition? Possible
    values are

    * `APPEND` - appends data to existing partitions
    * `OVERWRITE` - overwrites existing partitions
    * `ERROR` - modifying existing partitions is not allowed

    The equivalent catalog session property is `insert_existing_partitions_behavior`.
  - `APPEND`
* - `hive.target-max-file-size`
  - Best effort maximum size of new files.
  - `1GB`
* - `hive.create-empty-bucket-files`
  - Should empty files be created for buckets that have no data?
  - `false`
* - `hive.validate-bucketing`
  - Enables validation that data is in the correct bucket when reading bucketed
    tables.

    the coordinator. Certain optimizations are not possible without eager
    loading.
  - 100,000
* - `hive.max-partitions-per-scan`
  - Maximum number of partitions for a single table scan.
  - 1,000,000

  - Enables automatic column level statistics collection on write. See
    [](hive-table-statistics) for details.
  - `true`
* - `hive.file-status-cache-tables`
  - Cache directory listing for specific tables. Examples:

    * `fruit.apple,fruit.orange` to cache listings only for tables
      `apple` and `orange` in schema `fruit`

    3.1+, this must be set to UTC.
  - JVM default
* - `hive.timestamp-precision`
  - Specifies the precision to use for Hive columns of type `TIMESTAMP`.
    Possible values are `MILLISECONDS`, `MICROSECONDS` and `NANOSECONDS`.
    Values with higher precision than configured are rounded. The equivalent
    [catalog session property](/sql/set-session) is `timestamp_precision` for
    session specific use.
  - `MILLISECONDS`
* - `hive.temporary-staging-directory-enabled`
  - Controls whether the temporary staging directory configured at
    `hive.temporary-staging-directory-path` is used for write operations.
    Temporary staging directory is never used for writes to non-sorted tables on
    S3, encrypted HDFS or external location. Writes to sorted tables will
    utilize this path for staging temporary files during sorting operation. When
    disabled, the target storage will be used for staging while writing sorted
    tables which can be inefficient when writing to object stores like S3.
  - `true`
* - `hive.temporary-staging-directory-path`
  - Controls the location of temporary staging directory that is used for write
    operations. The `${USER}` placeholder can be used to use a different
    location for each user.
  - `/tmp/presto-${USER}`
* - `hive.hive-views.enabled`
  - Enable translation for [Hive views](hive-views).
  - `false`
* - `hive.hive-views.legacy-translation`
  - Use the legacy algorithm to translate [Hive views](hive-views). You
    can use the `hive_views_legacy_translation` catalog session property for
    temporary, catalog specific use.
  - `false`
* - `hive.parallel-partitioned-bucketed-writes`
  - Improve parallelism of partitioned and bucketed table writes. When disabled,
    the number of writing threads is limited to number of buckets.
  - `true`
* - `hive.query-partition-filter-required`
  - Set to `true` to force a query to use a partition filter. You can use the
    `query_partition_filter_required` catalog session property for temporary,
    catalog specific use.
  - `false`
* - `hive.query-partition-filter-required-schemas`
  - Allow specifying the list of schemas for which Trino will enforce that
    queries use a filter on partition keys for source tables. The list can be
    specified using the `hive.query-partition-filter-required-schemas`,
    or the `query_partition_filter_required_schemas` session property. The list
    is taken into consideration only if the `hive.query-partition-filter-required`
    configuration property or the `query_partition_filter_required` session
    property is set to `true`.
  - `[]`
* - `hive.table-statistics-enabled`
  - Enables [](/optimizer/statistics). The equivalent [catalog session
    property](/sql/set-session) is `statistics_enabled` for session specific
    use. Set to `false` to disable statistics. Disabling statistics means that
    [](/optimizer/cost-based-optimizations) can not make smart decisions about
    the query plan.
  - `true`
* - `hive.auto-purge`
  - Set the default value for the auto_purge table property for managed tables.
    See the [](hive-table-properties) for more information on auto_purge.
  - `false`
* - `hive.partition-projection-enabled`
  - Enables Athena partition projection support
  - `false`
* - `hive.max-partition-drops-per-query`
  - Maximum number of partitions to drop in a single query.
  - 100,000
* - `hive.single-statement-writes`
  - Enables auto-commit for all writes. This can be used to disallow
    multi-statement write transactions.
  - `false`
* - `hive.metadata.parallelism`
  - Number of threads used for retrieving metadata. Currently, only table loading
    is parallelized.
  - `8`
:::

(hive-file-system-configuration)=
### File system access configuration

The connector supports accessing the following file systems:

* [](/object-storage/file-system-azure)
* [](/object-storage/file-system-gcs)
* [](/object-storage/file-system-s3)
* [](/object-storage/file-system-hdfs)

You must enable and configure the specific file system access. [Legacy
support](file-system-legacy) is not recommended and will be removed.

(hive-fte-support)=
### Fault-tolerant execution support

The connector supports {doc}`/admin/fault-tolerant-execution` of query
processing. Read and write operations are both supported with any retry policy
on non-transactional tables.

Read operations are supported with any retry policy on transactional tables.
Write operations and `CREATE TABLE ... AS` operations are not supported with
any retry policy on transactional tables.

(hive-security)=
## Security

The connector supports different means of authentication for the used [file
system](hive-file-system-configuration) and [metastore](hive-configuration).

In addition, the following security-related features are supported.

(hive-authorization)=
## Authorization

You can enable authorization checks by setting the `hive.security` property in
the catalog properties file. This property must be one of the following values:

:::{list-table} `hive.security` property values
:widths: 30, 60
:header-rows: 1

* - Property value
  - Description
* - `allow-all` (default value)
  - No authorization checks are enforced.
* - `read-only`
  - Operations that read data or metadata, such as `SELECT`, are permitted, but
    none of the operations that write data or metadata, such as `CREATE`,
    `INSERT` or `DELETE`, are allowed.
* - `file`
  - Authorization checks are enforced using a catalog-level access control
    configuration file whose path is specified in the `security.config-file`
    catalog configuration property. See [](catalog-file-based-access-control)
    for details.
* - `sql-standard`
  - Users are permitted to perform the operations as long as they have the
    required privileges as per the SQL standard. In this mode, Trino enforces
    the authorization checks for queries based on the privileges defined in Hive
    metastore. To alter these privileges, use the [](/sql/grant) and
    [](/sql/revoke) commands.

    See the [](hive-sql-standard-based-authorization) section for details.
:::

(hive-sql-standard-based-authorization)=
### SQL standard based authorization

When `sql-standard` security is enabled, Trino enforces the same SQL
standard-based authorization as Hive does.

Since Trino's `ROLE` syntax support matches the SQL standard, and
Hive does not exactly follow the SQL standard, there are the following
limitations and differences:

- `CREATE ROLE role WITH ADMIN` is not supported.
- The `admin` role must be enabled to execute `CREATE ROLE`, `DROP ROLE` or `CREATE SCHEMA`.
- `GRANT role TO user GRANTED BY someone` is not supported.
- `REVOKE role FROM user GRANTED BY someone` is not supported.
- By default, all a user's roles, except `admin`, are enabled in a new user session.
- One particular role can be selected by executing `SET ROLE role`.
- `SET ROLE ALL` enables all of a user's roles except `admin`.
- The `admin` role must be enabled explicitly by executing `SET ROLE admin`.
- `GRANT privilege ON SCHEMA schema` is not supported. Schema ownership can be
  changed with `ALTER SCHEMA schema SET AUTHORIZATION user`

(hive-sql-support)=
## SQL support

The connector provides read access and write access to data and metadata in the
configured object storage system and metadata stores:

on migrating from Hive to Trino.

The following sections provide Hive-specific information regarding SQL support.

(hive-examples)=
### Basic usage examples

The examples shown here work on Google Cloud Storage by replacing `s3://` with
`gs://`.

Create a new Hive table named `page_views` in the `web` schema
that is stored using the ORC file format, partitioned by date and
country, and bucketed by user into `50` buckets. Note that Hive
requires the partition columns to be the last columns in the table:

```
CREATE TABLE example.web.page_views (
  view_time TIMESTAMP,
  user_id BIGINT,
  page_url VARCHAR,
  ds DATE,
  country VARCHAR
)
WITH (
  format = 'ORC',
  partitioned_by = ARRAY['ds', 'country'],
  bucketed_by = ARRAY['user_id'],
  bucket_count = 50
)
```

Create a new Hive schema named `web` that stores tables in an
S3 bucket named `my-bucket`:

```
CREATE SCHEMA example.web
WITH (location = 's3://my-bucket/')
```

Drop a schema:

```
DROP SCHEMA example.web
```

Drop a partition from the `page_views` table:

```
DELETE FROM example.web.page_views
WHERE ds = DATE '2016-08-09'
  AND country = 'US'
```

Query the `page_views` table:

```
SELECT * FROM example.web.page_views
```

List the partitions of the `page_views` table:

```
SELECT * FROM example.web."page_views$partitions"
```

Create an external Hive table named `request_logs` that points at
existing data in S3:

```
CREATE TABLE example.web.request_logs (
  request_time TIMESTAMP,
  url VARCHAR,
  ip VARCHAR,
  user_agent VARCHAR
)
WITH (
  format = 'TEXTFILE',
  external_location = 's3://my-bucket/data/logs/'
)
```

Collect statistics for the `request_logs` table:

```
ANALYZE example.web.request_logs;
```

Drop the external table `request_logs`. This only drops the metadata
for the table. The referenced data directory is not deleted:

```
DROP TABLE example.web.request_logs
```

- {doc}`/sql/create-table-as` can be used to create transactional tables in ORC format like this:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE <name>
  WITH (
      format='ORC',
      transactional=true
  )
  AS <query>
  ```

Add an empty partition to the `page_views` table:

```
CALL system.create_empty_partition(
    schema_name => 'web',
    table_name => 'page_views',
    partition_columns => ARRAY['ds', 'country'],
    partition_values => ARRAY['2016-08-09', 'US']);
```

Drop stats for a partition of the `page_views` table:

```
CALL system.drop_stats(
    schema_name => 'web',
    table_name => 'page_views',
    partition_values => ARRAY[ARRAY['2016-08-09', 'US']]);
```

(hive-procedures)=
### Procedures

Use the {doc}`/sql/call` statement to perform data manipulation or
administrative tasks. Procedures must include a qualified catalog name, if your
Hive catalog is called `web`:

```
CALL web.system.example_procedure()
```

The following procedures are available:

- `system.create_empty_partition(schema_name, table_name, partition_columns, partition_values)`

  Create an empty partition in the specified table.

- `system.sync_partition_metadata(schema_name, table_name, mode, case_sensitive)`

  Check and update partitions list in metastore. There are three modes available:

  - `ADD` : add any partitions that exist on the file system, but not in the metastore.
  - `DROP`: drop any partitions that exist in the metastore, but not on the file system.
  - `FULL`: perform both `ADD` and `DROP`.

  The `case_sensitive` argument is optional. The default value is `true` for compatibility
  with Hive's `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` behavior, which expects the partition column names in
  file system paths to use lowercase (e.g. `col_x=SomeValue`). Partitions on the file system
  not conforming to this convention are ignored, unless the argument is set to `false`.

- `system.drop_stats(schema_name, table_name, partition_values)`

  Drops statistics for a subset of partitions or the entire table. The partitions are specified as an
  array whose elements are arrays of partition values (similar to the `partition_values` argument in
  `create_empty_partition`). If `partition_values` argument is omitted, stats are dropped for the
  entire table.

(register-partition)=
- `system.register_partition(schema_name, table_name, partition_columns, partition_values, location)`

  Registers existing location as a new partition in the metastore for the specified table.

  When the `location` argument is omitted, the partition location is
  constructed using `partition_columns` and `partition_values`.

  Due to security reasons, the procedure is enabled only when `hive.allow-register-partition-procedure`
  is set to `true`.

(unregister-partition)=
- `system.unregister_partition(schema_name, table_name, partition_columns, partition_values)`

  Unregisters given, existing partition in the metastore for the specified table.
  The partition data is not deleted.

(hive-flush-metadata-cache)=
- `system.flush_metadata_cache()`

  Flush all Hive metadata caches.

- `system.flush_metadata_cache(schema_name => ..., table_name => ...)`

  Flush Hive metadata caches entries connected with selected table.
  Procedure requires named parameters to be passed

- `system.flush_metadata_cache(schema_name => ..., table_name => ..., partition_columns => ARRAY[...], partition_values => ARRAY[...])`

  Flush Hive metadata cache entries connected with selected partition.
  Procedure requires named parameters to be passed.

(hive-data-management)=
### Data management

The {ref}`sql-data-management` functionality includes support for `INSERT`,
`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` statements, with the exact support
depending on the storage system, file format, and metastore.

When connecting to a Hive metastore version 3.x, the Hive connector supports
reading from and writing to insert-only and ACID tables, with full support for
partitioning and bucketing.

{doc}`/sql/delete` applied to non-transactional tables is only supported if the
table is partitioned and the `WHERE` clause matches entire partitions.
Transactional Hive tables with ORC format support "row-by-row" deletion, in
which the `WHERE` clause may match arbitrary sets of rows.

{doc}`/sql/update` is only supported for transactional Hive tables with format
ORC. `UPDATE` of partition or bucket columns is not supported.

{doc}`/sql/merge` is only supported for ACID tables.

ACID tables created with [Hive Streaming Ingest](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Streaming+Data+Ingest)
are not supported.

(hive-schema-and-table-management)=
### Schema and table management

The Hive connector supports querying and manipulating Hive tables and schemas
(databases). While some uncommon operations must be performed using
Hive directly, most operations can be performed using Trino.

#### Schema evolution

Hive table partitions can differ from the current table schema. This occurs when
the data types of columns of a table are changed from the data types of columns
of preexisting partitions. The Hive connector supports this schema evolution by
allowing the same conversions as Hive. The following table lists possible data
type conversions.

:::{list-table} Hive schema evolution type conversion
:widths: 25, 75
:header-rows: 1

* - Data type
  - Converted to
* - `BOOLEAN`
  - `VARCHAR`
* - `VARCHAR`
  - `BOOLEAN`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, `CHAR` as well as
    narrowing conversions for `VARCHAR`
* - `CHAR`
  - `VARCHAR`, narrowing conversions for `CHAR`
* - `TINYINT`
  - `VARCHAR`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL`
* - `SMALLINT`
  - `VARCHAR`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL`
* - `INTEGER`
  - `VARCHAR`, `BIGINT`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL`
* - `BIGINT`
  - `VARCHAR`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL`
* - `REAL`
  - `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL`
* - `DOUBLE`
  - `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`
* - `DECIMAL`
  - `DOUBLE`, `REAL`, `VARCHAR`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, as
    well as narrowing and widening conversions for `DECIMAL`
* - `DATE`
  - `VARCHAR`
* - `TIMESTAMP`
  - `VARCHAR`, `DATE`
* - `VARBINARY`
  - `VARCHAR`
:::

Any conversion failure results in null, which is the same behavior
as Hive. For example, converting the string `'foo'` to a number,
or converting the string `'1234'` to a `TINYINT` (which has a
maximum value of `127`).

(hive-avro-schema)=
#### Avro schema evolution

Trino supports querying and manipulating Hive tables with the Avro storage
format, which has the schema set based on an Avro schema file/literal. Trino is
also capable of creating the tables in Trino by infering the schema from a
valid Avro schema file located locally, or remotely in HDFS/Web server.

To specify that the Avro schema should be used for interpreting table data, use
the `avro_schema_url` table property.

The schema can be placed in the local file system or remotely in the following
locations:

- HDFS (e.g. `avro_schema_url = 'hdfs://user/avro/schema/avro_data.avsc'`)
- S3 (e.g. `avro_schema_url = 's3n:///schema_bucket/schema/avro_data.avsc'`)
- A web server (e.g. `avro_schema_url = 'http://example.org/schema/avro_data.avsc'`)

The URL, where the schema is located, must be accessible from the Hive metastore
and Trino coordinator/worker nodes.

Alternatively, you can use the table property `avro_schema_literal` to define
the Avro schema.

The table created in Trino using the `avro_schema_url` or
`avro_schema_literal` property behaves the same way as a Hive table with
`avro.schema.url` or `avro.schema.literal` set.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE example.avro.avro_data (
   id BIGINT
 )
WITH (
   format = 'AVRO',
   avro_schema_url = '/usr/local/avro_data.avsc'
)
```

The columns listed in the DDL (`id` in the above example) is ignored if `avro_schema_url` is specified.
The table schema matches the schema in the Avro schema file. Before any read operation, the Avro schema is
accessed so the query result reflects any changes in schema. Thus Trino takes advantage of Avro's backward compatibility abilities.

If the schema of the table changes in the Avro schema file, the new schema can still be used to read old data.
Newly added/renamed fields *must* have a default value in the Avro schema file.

The schema evolution behavior is as follows:

- Column added in new schema:
  Data created with an older schema produces a *default* value when table is using the new schema.
- Column removed in new schema:
  Data created with an older schema no longer outputs the data from the column that was removed.
- Column is renamed in the new schema:
  This is equivalent to removing the column and adding a new one, and data created with an older schema
  produces a *default* value when table is using the new schema.
- Changing type of column in the new schema:
  If the type coercion is supported by Avro or the Hive connector, then the conversion happens.
  An error is thrown for incompatible types.

##### Limitations

The following operations are not supported when `avro_schema_url` is set:

- `CREATE TABLE AS` is not supported.
- Bucketing(`bucketed_by`) columns are not supported in `CREATE TABLE`.
- `ALTER TABLE` commands modifying columns are not supported.

(hive-alter-table-execute)=
#### ALTER TABLE EXECUTE

The connector supports the following commands for use with {ref}`ALTER TABLE
EXECUTE <alter-table-execute>`.

```{include} optimize.fragment
```

The `optimize` command is disabled by default, and can be enabled for a
catalog with the `<catalog-name>.non_transactional_optimize_enabled`
session property:

```sql
SET SESSION <catalog_name>.non_transactional_optimize_enabled=true
```

:::{warning}
Because Hive tables are non-transactional, take note of the following possible
outcomes:

- If queries are run against tables that are currently being optimized,
  duplicate rows may be read.
- In rare cases where exceptions occur during the `optimize` operation,
  a manual cleanup of the table directory is needed. In this situation, refer
  to the Trino logs and query failure messages to see which files must be
  deleted.
:::

(hive-table-properties)=
#### Table properties

Table properties supply or set metadata for the underlying tables. This
is key for {doc}`/sql/create-table-as` statements. Table properties are passed
to the connector using a {doc}`WITH </sql/create-table-as>` clause:

```
CREATE TABLE tablename
WITH (format='CSV',
      csv_escape = '"')

:::

(hive-special-tables)=
#### Metadata tables

The raw Hive table properties are available as a hidden table, containing a
separate column per table property, with a single row containing the property
values.

##### `$properties` table

The properties table name is composed with the table name and `$properties` appended.
It exposes the parameters of the table in the metastore.

You can inspect the property names and values with a simple query:

```
SELECT * FROM example.web."page_views$properties";
```

```text

:::

(hive-special-columns)=
#### Metadata columns

In addition to the defined columns, the Hive connector automatically exposes
metadata in a number of hidden columns in each table:

- `$bucket`: Bucket number for this row
- `$path`: Full file system path name of the file for this row
- `$file_modified_time`: Date and time of the last modification of the file for this row
- `$file_size`: Size of the file for this row
- `$partition`: Partition name for this row

You can use these columns in your SQL statements like any other column. They
can be selected directly, or used in conditional statements. For example, you
can inspect the file size, location and partition for each record:

```
SELECT *, "$path", "$file_size", "$partition"
FROM example.web.page_views;
```

Retrieve all records that belong to files stored in the partition
`ds=2016-08-09/country=US`:

```
SELECT *, "$path", "$file_size"
FROM example.web.page_views
WHERE "$partition" = 'ds=2016-08-09/country=US'
```

(hive-sql-view-management)=
### View management

Trino allows reading from Hive materialized views, and can be configured to
support reading Hive views.

#### Materialized views

The Hive connector supports reading from Hive materialized views.
In Trino, these views are presented as regular, read-only tables.

(hive-views)=
#### Hive views

Hive views are defined in HiveQL and stored in the Hive Metastore Service. They
are analyzed to allow read access to the data.

The Hive connector includes support for reading Hive views with three different
modes.

- Disabled
- Legacy
- Experimental

If using Hive views from Trino is required, you must compare results in Hive and
Trino for each view definition to ensure identical results. Use the experimental
mode whenever possible. Avoid using the legacy mode. Leave Hive views support
disabled, if you are not accessing any Hive views from Trino.

You can configure the behavior in your catalog properties file.

By default, Hive views are executed with the `RUN AS DEFINER` security mode.
Set the  `hive.hive-views.run-as-invoker` catalog configuration property to
`true` to use `RUN AS INVOKER` semantics.

**Disabled**

The default behavior is to ignore Hive views. This means that your business
logic and data encoded in the views is not available in Trino.

**Legacy**

A very simple implementation to execute Hive views, and therefore allow read
access to the data in Trino, can be enabled with
`hive.hive-views.enabled=true` and
`hive.hive-views.legacy-translation=true`.

For temporary usage of the legacy behavior for a specific catalog, you can set
the `hive_views_legacy_translation` {doc}`catalog session property
</sql/set-session>` to `true`.

This legacy behavior interprets any HiveQL query that defines a view as if it
is written in SQL. It does not do any translation, but instead relies on the
fact that HiveQL is very similar to SQL.

This works for very simple Hive views, but can lead to problems for more complex
queries. For example, if a HiveQL function has an identical signature but
different behaviors to the SQL version, the returned results may differ. In more
extreme cases the queries might fail, or not even be able to be parsed and
executed.

**Experimental**

The new behavior is better engineered and has the potential to become a lot
more powerful than the legacy implementation. It can analyze, process, and
rewrite Hive views and contained expressions and statements.

It supports the following Hive view functionality:

- `UNION [DISTINCT]` and `UNION ALL` against Hive views
- Nested `GROUP BY` clauses
- `current_user()`
- `LATERAL VIEW OUTER EXPLODE`
- `LATERAL VIEW [OUTER] EXPLODE` on array of struct
- `LATERAL VIEW json_tuple`

You can enable the experimental behavior with
`hive.hive-views.enabled=true`. Remove the
`hive.hive-views.legacy-translation` property or set it to `false` to make
sure legacy is not enabled.

Keep in mind that numerous features are not yet implemented when experimenting
with this feature. The following is an incomplete list of **missing**
functionality:

- HiveQL `current_date`, `current_timestamp`, and others
- Hive function calls including `translate()`, window functions, and others
- Common table expressions and simple case expressions
- Honor timestamp precision setting
- Support all Hive data types and correct mapping to Trino types
- Ability to process custom UDFs


## Performance

The connector includes a number of performance improvements, detailed in the
following sections.


(hive-table-statistics)=
### Table statistics

The Hive connector supports collecting and managing {doc}`table statistics
</optimizer/statistics>` to improve query processing performance.

When writing data, the Hive connector always collects basic statistics
(`numFiles`, `numRows`, `rawDataSize`, `totalSize`)
and by default will also collect column level statistics:

:::{list-table} Available table statistics
:widths: 35, 65
:header-rows: 1

* - Column type
  - Collectible statistics
* - `TINYINT`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `SMALLINT`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `INTEGER`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `BIGINT`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `DOUBLE`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `REAL`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `DECIMAL`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `DATE`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `TIMESTAMP`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values, min/max values
* - `VARCHAR`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values
* - `CHAR`
  - Number of nulls, number of distinct values
* - `VARBINARY`
  - Number of nulls
* - `BOOLEAN`
  - Number of nulls, number of true/false values
:::

(hive-analyze)=
#### Updating table and partition statistics

If your queries are complex and include joining large data sets,
running {doc}`/sql/analyze` on tables/partitions may improve query performance
by collecting statistical information about the data.

When analyzing a partitioned table, the partitions to analyze can be specified
via the optional `partitions` property, which is an array containing
the values of the partition keys in the order they are declared in the table schema:

```
ANALYZE table_name WITH (
    partitions = ARRAY[
        ARRAY['p1_value1', 'p1_value2'],
        ARRAY['p2_value1', 'p2_value2']])
```

This query will collect statistics for two partitions with keys
`p1_value1, p1_value2` and `p2_value1, p2_value2`.

On wide tables, collecting statistics for all columns can be expensive and can have a
detrimental effect on query planning. It is also typically unnecessary - statistics are
only useful on specific columns, like join keys, predicates, grouping keys. One can
specify a subset of columns to be analyzed via the optional `columns` property:

```
ANALYZE table_name WITH (
    partitions = ARRAY[ARRAY['p2_value1', 'p2_value2']],
    columns = ARRAY['col_1', 'col_2'])
```

This query collects statistics for columns `col_1` and `col_2` for the partition
with keys `p2_value1, p2_value2`.

Note that if statistics were previously collected for all columns, they must be dropped
before re-analyzing just a subset:

```
CALL system.drop_stats('schema_name', 'table_name')
```

You can also drop statistics for selected partitions only:

```
CALL system.drop_stats(
    schema_name => 'schema',
    table_name => 'table',
    partition_values => ARRAY[ARRAY['p2_value1', 'p2_value2']])
```

(hive-dynamic-filtering)=
### Dynamic filtering

The Hive connector supports the {doc}`dynamic filtering </admin/dynamic-filtering>` optimization.
Dynamic partition pruning is supported for partitioned tables stored in any file format
for broadcast as well as partitioned joins.
Dynamic bucket pruning is supported for bucketed tables stored in any file format for
broadcast joins only.

For tables stored in ORC or Parquet file format, dynamic filters are also pushed into
local table scan on worker nodes for broadcast joins. Dynamic filter predicates
pushed into the ORC and Parquet readers are used to perform stripe or row-group pruning
and save on disk I/O. Sorting the data within ORC or Parquet files by the columns used in
join criteria significantly improves the effectiveness of stripe or row-group pruning.
This is because grouping similar data within the same stripe or row-group
greatly improves the selectivity of the min/max indexes maintained at stripe or
row-group level.

#### Delaying execution for dynamic filters

It can often be beneficial to wait for the collection of dynamic filters before starting
a table scan. This extra wait time can potentially result in significant overall savings
in query and CPU time, if dynamic filtering is able to reduce the amount of scanned data.

For the Hive connector, a table scan can be delayed for a configured amount of
time until the collection of dynamic filters by using the configuration property
`hive.dynamic-filtering.wait-timeout` in the catalog file or the catalog
session property `<hive-catalog>.dynamic_filtering_wait_timeout`.

(hive-table-redirection)=
### Table redirection

```{include} table-redirection.fragment
```

The connector supports redirection from Hive tables to Iceberg, Delta Lake, and
Hudi tables with the following catalog configuration properties:

- `hive.iceberg-catalog-name`: Name of the catalog, configured with the
  [](/connector/iceberg), to use for reading Iceberg tables.
- `hive.delta-lake-catalog-name`: Name of the catalog, configured with the
  [](/connector/delta-lake), to use for reading Delta Lake tables.
- `hive.hudi-catalog-name`: Name of the catalog, configured with the
  [](/connector/hudi), to use for reading Hudi tables.

### File system cache

The connector supports configuring and using [file system
caching](/object-storage/file-system-cache).

(hive-performance-tuning-configuration)=
### Performance tuning configuration properties

The following table describes performance tuning properties for the Hive
connector.

:::{warning}
Performance tuning configuration properties are considered expert-level
features. Altering these properties from their default values is likely to
cause instability and performance degradation.
:::

:::{list-table}
:widths: 30, 50, 20
:header-rows: 1

* - Property name
  - Description
  - Default value
* - `hive.max-outstanding-splits`
  - The target number of buffered splits for each table scan in a query, before
    the scheduler tries to pause.
  - `1000`
* - `hive.max-outstanding-splits-size`
  - The maximum size allowed for buffered splits for each table scan in a query,
    before the query fails.
  - `256 MB`
* - `hive.max-splits-per-second`
  - The maximum number of splits generated per second per table scan. This can
    be used to reduce the load on the storage system. By default, there is no
    limit, which results in Trino maximizing the parallelization of data access.
  -
* - `hive.max-initial-splits`
  - For each table scan, the coordinator first assigns file sections of up to
    `max-initial-split-size`. After `max-initial-splits` have been assigned,
    `max-split-size` is used for the remaining splits.
  - `200`
* - `hive.max-initial-split-size`
  - The size of a single file section assigned to a worker until
    `max-initial-splits` have been assigned. Smaller splits results in more
    parallelism, which gives a boost to smaller queries.
  - `32 MB`
* - `hive.max-split-size`
  - The largest size of a single file section assigned to a worker. Smaller
        splits result in more parallelism and thus can decrease latency, but
        also have more overhead and increase load on the system.
  - `64 MB`
:::

## Hive 3-related limitations

- For security reasons, the `sys` system catalog is not accessible.
- Hive's `timestamp with local zone` data type is mapped to
  `timestamp with time zone` with UTC timezone. It only supports reading
  values - writing to tables with columns of this type is not supported.
- Due to Hive issues [HIVE-21002](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21002)
  and [HIVE-22167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22167), Trino does
  not correctly read `TIMESTAMP` values from Parquet, RCBinary, or Avro
  file formats created by Hive 3.1 or later. When reading from these file formats,
  Trino returns different results than Hive.
- Trino does not support gathering table statistics for Hive transactional tables.
  You must use Hive to gather table statistics with
  [ANALYZE statement](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/hive/statsdev#StatsDev-ExistingTables%E2%80%93ANALYZE)
  after table creation.
