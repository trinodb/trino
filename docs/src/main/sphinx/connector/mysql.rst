MySQL connector
===============

The MySQL connector allows querying and creating tables in an external
`MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`_ instance. This can be used to join data between different
systems like MySQL and Hive, or between two different MySQL instances.

Requirements
------------

To connect to MySQL, you need:

* MySQL 5.7, 8.0 or higher.
* Network access from the Trino coordinator and workers to MySQL.
  Port 3306 is the default port.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the MySQL connector, create a catalog properties file
in ``etc/catalog`` named, for example, ``mysql.properties``, to
mount the MySQL connector as the ``mysql`` catalog.
Create the file with the following contents, replacing the
connection properties as appropriate for your setup:

.. code-block:: text

    connector.name=mysql
    connection-url=jdbc:mysql://example.net:3306
    connection-user=root
    connection-password=secret

Multiple MySQL servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can have as many catalogs as you need, so if you have additional
MySQL servers, simply add another properties file to ``etc/catalog``
with a different name, making sure it ends in ``.properties``. For
example, if you name the property file ``sales.properties``, Trino
creates a catalog named ``sales`` using the configured connector.

.. _mysql-type-mapping:

Type mapping
------------

Decimal type handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``DECIMAL`` types with precision larger than 38 can be mapped to a Trino ``DECIMAL``
by setting the ``decimal-mapping`` configuration property or the ``decimal_mapping`` session property to
``allow_overflow``. The scale of the resulting type is controlled via the ``decimal-default-scale``
configuration property or the ``decimal-rounding-mode`` session property. The precision is always 38.

By default, values that require rounding or truncation to fit will cause a failure at runtime. This behavior
is controlled via the ``decimal-rounding-mode`` configuration property or the ``decimal_rounding_mode`` session
property, which can be set to ``UNNECESSARY`` (the default),
``UP``, ``DOWN``, ``CEILING``, ``FLOOR``, ``HALF_UP``, ``HALF_DOWN``, or ``HALF_EVEN``
(see `RoundingMode <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/RoundingMode.html#enum.constant.summary>`_).

Querying MySQL
--------------

The MySQL connector provides a schema for every MySQL *database*.
You can see the available MySQL databases by running ``SHOW SCHEMAS``::

    SHOW SCHEMAS FROM mysql;

If you have a MySQL database named ``web``, you can view the tables
in this database by running ``SHOW TABLES``::

    SHOW TABLES FROM mysql.web;

You can see a list of the columns in the ``clicks`` table in the ``web`` database
using either of the following::

    DESCRIBE mysql.web.clicks;
    SHOW COLUMNS FROM mysql.web.clicks;

Finally, you can access the ``clicks`` table in the ``web`` database::

    SELECT * FROM mysql.web.clicks;

If you used a different name for your catalog properties file, use
that catalog name instead of ``mysql`` in the above examples.


.. _mysql-pushdown:

Pushdown
--------

The connector supports pushdown for a number of operations:

* :ref:`join-pushdown`
* :ref:`limit-pushdown`
* :ref:`topn-pushdown`

:ref:`Aggregate pushdown <aggregation-pushdown>` for the following functions:

* :func:`avg`
* :func:`count`
* :func:`max`
* :func:`min`
* :func:`sum`
* :func:`stddev`
* :func:`stddev_pop`
* :func:`stddev_samp`
* :func:`variance`
* :func:`var_pop`
* :func:`var_samp`

Limitations
-----------

The following SQL statements are not yet supported:

* :doc:`/sql/delete`
* :doc:`/sql/grant`
* :doc:`/sql/revoke`
* :doc:`/sql/show-grants`
* :doc:`/sql/show-roles`
* :doc:`/sql/show-role-grants`
