# JMX connector

The JMX connector provides the ability to query Java Management Extensions (JMX)
information from all
nodes in a Trino cluster. This is very useful for monitoring or debugging.
JMX provides information about the Java
Virtual Machine and all the software running inside it. Trino itself
is heavily instrumented via JMX.

This connector can be configured so that chosen JMX information is
periodically dumped and stored in memory for later access.

## Configuration

To configure the JMX connector, create a catalog properties file
`etc/catalog/example.properties` with the following contents:

```text
connector.name=jmx
```

To enable periodical dumps, define the following properties:

```text
connector.name=jmx
jmx.dump-tables=java.lang:type=Runtime,trino.execution.scheduler:name=NodeScheduler
jmx.dump-period=10s
jmx.max-entries=86400
```

`dump-tables` is a comma separated list of Managed Beans (MBean). It specifies
which MBeans are sampled and stored in memory every `dump-period`. You can
configure the maximum number of history entries with `max-entries` and it
defaults to `86400`. The time between dumps can be configured using
`dump-period` and it defaults to `10s`.

Commas in MBean names must be escaped using double backslashes (`\\`) in the
following manner:

```text
connector.name=jmx
jmx.dump-tables=trino.memory:name=general\\,type=memorypool,trino.memory:name=reserved\\,type=memorypool
```

Double backslashes are required because a single backslash (`\`) is used to
split the value across multiple lines in the following manner:

```text
connector.name=jmx
jmx.dump-tables=trino.memory:name=general\\,type=memorypool,\
    trino.memory:name=reserved\\,type=memorypool
```

## Querying JMX

The JMX connector provides two schemas.

The first one is `current` that contains every MBean from every node in the Trino
cluster. You can see all the available MBeans by running `SHOW TABLES`:

```
SHOW TABLES FROM example.current;
```

MBean names map to non-standard table names, and must be quoted with
double quotes when referencing them in a query. For example, the
following query shows the JVM version of every node:

```
SELECT node, vmname, vmversion
FROM example.current."java.lang:type=runtime";
```

```text
                 node                 |              vmname               | vmversion
--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------
 ddc4df17-0b8e-4843-bb14-1b8af1a7451a | Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM | 24.60-b09
(1 row)
```

The following query shows the open and maximum file descriptor counts
for each node:

```
SELECT openfiledescriptorcount, maxfiledescriptorcount
FROM example.current."java.lang:type=operatingsystem";
```

```text
 openfiledescriptorcount | maxfiledescriptorcount
-------------------------+------------------------
                     329 |                  10240
(1 row)
```

The wildcard character `*` may be used with table names in the `current` schema.
This allows matching several MBean objects within a single query. The following query
returns information from the different Trino memory pools on each node:

```
SELECT freebytes, node, object_name
FROM example.current."trino.memory:*type=memorypool*";
```

```text
 freebytes  |  node   |                       object_name
------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------
  214748364 | example | trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=reserved
 1073741825 | example | trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=general
  858993459 | example | trino.memory:type=MemoryPool,name=system
(3 rows)
```

The `history` schema contains the list of tables configured in the connector properties file.
The tables have the same columns as those in the current schema, but with an additional
timestamp column that stores the time at which the snapshot was taken:

```
SELECT "timestamp", "uptime" FROM example.history."java.lang:type=runtime";
```

```text
        timestamp        | uptime
-------------------------+--------
 2016-01-28 10:18:50.000 |  11420
 2016-01-28 10:19:00.000 |  21422
 2016-01-28 10:19:10.000 |  31412
(3 rows)
```

## SQL support

The connector provides {ref}`globally available <sql-globally-available>` and
{ref}`read operation <sql-read-operations>` statements to access JMX information
on your Trino nodes.
