# TPC-DS connector

The TPC-DS connector provides a set of schemas to support the
[TPC Benchmarkâ„¢ DS (TPC-DS)](http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/). TPC-DS is a database
benchmark used to measure the performance of complex decision support databases.

This connector can be used to test the capabilities and query
syntax of Trino without configuring access to an external data
source. When you query a TPC-DS schema, the connector generates the
data on the fly using a deterministic algorithm.

Use the [](/connector/faker) to create and query arbitrary data.

## Configuration

To configure the TPC-DS connector, create a catalog properties file
`etc/catalog/example.properties` with the following contents:

```text
connector.name=tpcds
```

## TPC-DS schemas

The TPC-DS connector supplies several schemas:

```
SHOW SCHEMAS FROM example;
```

```text
       Schema
--------------------
 information_schema
 sf1
 sf10
 sf100
 sf1000
 sf10000
 sf100000
 sf300
 sf3000
 sf30000
 tiny
(11 rows)
```

Ignore the standard schema `information_schema`, which exists in every
catalog, and is not directly provided by the TPC-DS connector.

Every TPC-DS schema provides the same set of tables. Some tables are
identical in all schemas. The *scale factor* of the tables in a particular
schema is determined from the schema name. For example, the schema
`sf1` corresponds to scale factor `1` and the schema `sf300`
corresponds to scale factor `300`. Every unit in the scale factor
corresponds to a gigabyte of data. For example, for scale factor `300`,
a total of `300` gigabytes are generated. The `tiny` schema is an
alias for scale factor `0.01`, which is a very small data set useful for
testing.

(tpcds-type-mapping)=
## Type mapping

Trino supports all data types used within the TPC-DS schemas so no mapping is
required.

(tpcds-sql-support)=
## SQL support

The connector provides {ref}`globally available <sql-globally-available>` and
{ref}`read operation <sql-read-operations>` statements to access data and
metadata in the TPC-DS dataset.
