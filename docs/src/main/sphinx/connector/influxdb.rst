=======================
InfluxDB connector
=======================

The InfluxDB Connector allows access to `InfluxDB <https://www.influxdata.com/>`_ data from Trino.
This document describes how to setup the InfluxDB Connector to run SQL queries against InfluxDB.

Requirements
------------

To connect to InfluxDB, you need:

* InfluxDB v1.8.0 or higher.(v2.x not currently supported)
* Network access from the Trino coordinator and workers to InfluxDB.
  Port 8086 is the default port.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the InfluxDB connector, create a catalog properties file
``etc/catalog/example.properties`` with the following contents,
replacing the properties as appropriate:

.. code-block:: properties

    connector.name=influxdb
    influx.endpoint=http://localhost:8086
    influx.username=username
    influx.password=password

Configuration properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table:: The following configuration properties are available
    :widths: 35, 55, 10
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Property name
      - Description
      - Default
    * - ``influx.endpoint``
      - Endpoint of the InfluxDB server to connect to. This property is required.
      -
    * - ``influx.username``
      - User name to use to connect to InfluxDB.
      -
    * - ``influx.password``
      - Password to use to connect to InfluxDB.
      -
    * - ``influx.connect-timeout``
      - The socket connect timeout to InfluxDB server.
      - ``10s``
    * - ``influx.write-timeout``
      - The socket write timeout to InfluxDB server.
      - ``10s``
    * - ``influx.read-timeout``
      - The socket read timeout to InfluxDB server.
      - ``60s``

.. _influxdb-type-mapping:

Type mapping
------------

Because Trino and InfluxDB each support types that the other does not, this
connector :ref:`maps some types <type-mapping-overview>` when reading data.


InfluxDB type to Trino type mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connector maps InfluxDB types to the corresponding Trino types
according to the following table:

.. list-table:: InfluxDB type to Trino type mapping
  :widths: 30, 30, 50
  :header-rows: 1

  * - InfluxDB type
    - Trino type
    - Notes
  * - ``TIMESTAMP``
    - ``TIMESTAMP``
    -  ``Timestamp`` key ``time`` is unix nanosecond timestamp in influxdb. see `data types <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types>`_.
  * - ``BOOLEAN``
    - ``BOOLEAN``
    -
  * - ``FLOAT``
    - ``DOUBLE``
    - ``FLOAT`` is 64-bit floating-point numbers in influxdb. see `data types <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types>`_.
  * - ``INTEGER``
    - ``BIGINT``
    - ``INTEGER`` is 64-bit integers in influxdb. see `data types <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types>`_.
  * - ``STRING``
    - ``VARCHAR``
    -

No other types are supported.


SQL support
-----------

The connector provides :ref:`globally available <sql-globally-available>` and
:ref:`read operation <sql-read-operations>` statements to access data and
metadata in the InfluxDB catalog.

Creation and deletion of schemas are supported.
As InfluxDB does not support creation of empty tables, creation of tables is not supported but deletion of tables is supported.

.. _influxdb-pushdown:

Pushdown support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connector supports pushdown for a number of operations:

* :ref:`limit-pushdown`

* :ref:`projection-pushdown`

* :ref:`predicate-pushdown`

But there are some special limitations for predicate-pushdown:

To understand easily, think a measurement "student" in influxdb

.. code-block:: text

    SHOW TAG KEYS:
    tagKey
    ------
    grade
    class

    SHOW FIELD KEYS:
    fieldKey fieldType
    -------- ---------
    name     string
    age      integer
    score    float


Predicate pushdown of keys of ``STRING``, ``BOOLEAN``, ``INTEGER`` and ``FLOAT`` types are supported:

For ``TIMESTAMP`` key, supports equality predicates ``=``, range predicates, such as ``>``, ``<``.

For keys of ``STRING`` or ``BOOLEAN`` type (both tag set and field keys in InfluxDB), supports equality predicates ``=`` only.

For keys of ``INTEGER`` or ``FLOAT`` type (field keys in InfluxDB), supports
equality predicates ``=``, inequality predicates ``!=``, and range predicates, such as ``>``, ``<``, or ``BETWEEN``.

.. note::
    Decimal integer literals ``int_lit = ("1"â€¦"9"){digit}`` pushdown works, hexadecimal and octal literals are not currently supported.
    Floating-point literals ``float_lit = int_lit"."int_lit`` pushdown works, exponents are not currently supported.

.. code-block:: sql

    -- Not pushed down
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE name > 'CLOUD';
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE score <> 1.0E2;
    -- Pushed down
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE name = 'CLOUD';
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE name != 'CLOUD';
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE age > 12 and age < 14;
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE score > 80.0 and score != 100;
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE time >= timestamp '2020-01-01 00:00:00' and time <= timestamp '2020-01-01 23:59:59';
