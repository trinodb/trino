### Case insensitive matching

When `case-insensitive-name-matching` is set to `true`, Trino
is able to query non-lowercase schemas and tables by maintaining a mapping of
the lowercase name to the actual name in the remote system. However, if two
schemas and/or tables have names that differ only in case (such as "customers"
and "Customers") then Trino fails to query them due to ambiguity.

In these cases, use the `case-insensitive-name-matching.config-file` catalog
configuration property to specify a configuration file that maps these remote
schemas/tables to their respective Trino schemas/tables:

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "remoteSchema": "CaseSensitiveName",
      "mapping": "case_insensitive_1"
    },
    {
      "remoteSchema": "cASEsENSITIVEnAME",
      "mapping": "case_insensitive_2"
    }],
  "tables": [
    {
      "remoteSchema": "CaseSensitiveName",
      "remoteTable": "tablex",
      "mapping": "table_1"
    },
    {
      "remoteSchema": "CaseSensitiveName",
      "remoteTable": "TABLEX",
      "mapping": "table_2"
    }]
}
```

Queries against one of the tables or schemes defined in the `mapping`
attributes are run against the corresponding remote entity. For example, a query
against tables in the `case_insensitive_1` schema is forwarded to the
CaseSensitiveName schema and a query against `case_insensitive_2` is forwarded
to the `cASEsENSITIVEnAME` schema.

At the table mapping level, a query on `case_insensitive_1.table_1` as
configured above is forwarded to `CaseSensitiveName.tablex`, and a query on
`case_insensitive_1.table_2` is forwarded to `CaseSensitiveName.TABLEX`.

By default, when a change is made to the mapping configuration file, Trino must
be restarted to load the changes. Optionally, you can set the
`case-insensitive-name-matching.config-file.refresh-period` to have Trino
refresh the properties without requiring a restart:

```properties
case-insensitive-name-matching.config-file.refresh-period=30s
```
