# Thrift connector

The Thrift connector makes it possible to integrate with external storage systems
without a custom Trino connector implementation by using
[Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) on these servers. It is therefore
generic and can provide access to any backend, as long as it exposes the expected
API by using Thrift.

In order to use the Thrift connector with an external system, you need to implement
the `TrinoThriftService` interface, found below. Next, you configure the Thrift connector
to point to a set of machines, called Thrift servers, that implement the interface.
As part of the interface implementation, the Thrift servers provide metadata,
splits and data. The connector randomly chooses a server to talk to from the available
instances for metadata calls, or for data calls unless the splits include a list of addresses.
All requests are assumed to be idempotent and can be retried freely among any server.

## Requirements

To connect to your custom servers with the Thrift protocol, you need:

- Network access from the Trino coordinator and workers to the Thrift servers.
- A {ref}`trino-thrift-service` for your system.

## Configuration

To configure the Thrift connector, create a catalog properties file
`etc/catalog/example.properties` with the following content, replacing the
properties as appropriate:

```text
connector.name=trino_thrift
trino.thrift.client.addresses=host:port,host:port
```

### Multiple Thrift systems

You can have as many catalogs as you need, so if you have additional
Thrift systems to connect to, simply add another properties file to `etc/catalog`
with a different name, making sure it ends in `.properties`.

## Configuration properties

The following configuration properties are available:

| Property name                              | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trino.thrift.client.addresses`            | Location of Thrift servers                               |
| `trino-thrift.max-response-size`           | Maximum size of data returned from Thrift server         |
| `trino-thrift.metadata-refresh-threads`    | Number of refresh threads for metadata cache             |
| `trino.thrift.client.max-retries`          | Maximum number of retries for failed Thrift requests     |
| `trino.thrift.client.max-backoff-delay`    | Maximum interval between retry attempts                  |
| `trino.thrift.client.min-backoff-delay`    | Minimum interval between retry attempts                  |
| `trino.thrift.client.max-retry-time`       | Maximum duration across all attempts of a Thrift request |
| `trino.thrift.client.backoff-scale-factor` | Scale factor for exponential back off                    |
| `trino.thrift.client.connect-timeout`      | Connect timeout                                          |
| `trino.thrift.client.request-timeout`      | Request timeout                                          |
| `trino.thrift.client.socks-proxy`          | SOCKS proxy address                                      |
| `trino.thrift.client.max-frame-size`       | Maximum size of a raw Thrift response                    |
| `trino.thrift.client.transport`            | Thrift transport type (`UNFRAMED`, `FRAMED`, `HEADER`)   |
| `trino.thrift.client.protocol`             | Thrift protocol type (`BINARY`, `COMPACT`, `FB_COMPACT`) |

### `trino.thrift.client.addresses`

Comma-separated list of thrift servers in the form of `host:port`. For example:

```text
trino.thrift.client.addresses=192.0.2.3:7777,192.0.2.4:7779
```

This property is required; there is no default.

### `trino-thrift.max-response-size`

Maximum size of a data response that the connector accepts. This value is sent
by the connector to the Thrift server when requesting data, allowing it to size
the response appropriately.

This property is optional; the default is `16MB`.

### `trino-thrift.metadata-refresh-threads`

Number of refresh threads for metadata cache.

This property is optional; the default is `1`.

(trino-thrift-service)=
## TrinoThriftService implementation

The following IDL describes the `TrinoThriftService` that must be implemented:

```{literalinclude} /include/TrinoThriftService.thrift
:language: thrift
```

(thrift-type-mapping)=
## Type mapping

The Thrift service defines data type support and mappings to Trino data types.

(thrift-sql-support)=
## SQL support

The connector provides {ref}`globally available <sql-globally-available>` and
{ref}`read operation <sql-read-operations>` statements to access data and
metadata in your Thrift service.
