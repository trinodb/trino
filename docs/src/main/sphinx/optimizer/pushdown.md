# Pushdown

Trino can push down the processing of queries, or parts of queries, into the
connected data source. This means that a specific predicate, aggregation
function, or other operation, is passed through to the underlying database or
storage system for processing.

The results of this pushdown can include the following benefits:

- Improved overall query performance
- Reduced network traffic between Trino and the data source
- Reduced load on the remote data source

These benefits often result in significant cost reduction.

Support for pushdown is specific to each connector and the relevant underlying
database or storage system.

(predicate-pushdown)=
## Predicate pushdown

Predicate pushdown optimizes row-based filtering. It uses the inferred filter,
typically resulting from a condition in a `WHERE` clause to omit unnecessary
rows. The processing is pushed down to the data source by the connector and then
processed by the data source.

If predicate pushdown for a specific clause is successful, the `EXPLAIN` plan
for the query does not include a `ScanFilterProject` operation for that
clause.

(projection-pushdown)=
## Projection pushdown

Projection pushdown optimizes column-based filtering. It uses the columns
specified in the `SELECT` clause and other parts of the query to limit access
to these columns. The processing is pushed down to the data source by the
connector and then the data source only reads and returns the necessary
columns.

If projection pushdown is successful, the `EXPLAIN` plan for the query only
accesses the relevant columns in the `Layout` of the `TableScan` operation.

(dereference-pushdown)=
## Dereference pushdown

Projection pushdown and dereference pushdown limit access to relevant columns,
except dereference pushdown is more selective. It limits access to only read the
specified fields within a top level or nested `ROW` data type.

For example, consider a table in the Hive connector that has a `ROW` type
column with several fields. If a query only accesses one field, dereference
pushdown allows the file reader to read only that single field within the row.
The same applies to fields of a row nested within the top level row. This can
result in significant savings in the amount of data read from the storage
system.

(aggregation-pushdown)=
## Aggregation pushdown

Aggregation pushdown can take place provided the following conditions are satisfied:

- If aggregation pushdown is generally supported by the connector.
- If pushdown of the specific function or functions is supported by the connector.
- If the query structure allows pushdown to take place.

You can check if pushdown for a specific query is performed by looking at the
{doc}`EXPLAIN plan </sql/explain>` of the query. If an aggregate function is successfully
pushed down to the connector, the explain plan does **not** show that `Aggregate` operator.
The explain plan only shows the operations that are performed by Trino.

As an example, we loaded the TPC-H data set into a PostgreSQL database and then
queried it using the PostgreSQL connector:

```
SELECT regionkey, count(*)
FROM nation
GROUP BY regionkey;
```

You can get the explain plan by prepending the above query with `EXPLAIN`:

```
EXPLAIN
SELECT regionkey, count(*)
FROM nation
GROUP BY regionkey;
```

The explain plan for this query does not show any `Aggregate` operator with
the `count` function, as this operation is now performed by the connector. You
can see the `count(*)` function as part of the PostgreSQL `TableScan`
operator. This shows you that the pushdown was successful.

        _generated_1 := count(*):_generated_1:bigint:bigint
        regionkey_0 := regionkey:bigint:int8
```

A number of factors can prevent a push-down:

- adding a condition to the query
- using a different aggregate function that cannot be pushed down into the connector
- using a connector without pushdown support for the specific function

As a result, the explain plan shows the `Aggregate` operation being performed
by Trino. This is a clear sign that now pushdown to the remote data source is not
performed, and instead Trino performs the aggregate processing.

```

### Limitations

Aggregation pushdown does not support a number of more complex statements:

- complex grouping operations such as `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, or `GROUPING SETS`
- expressions inside the aggregation function call: `sum(a * b)`
- coercions: `sum(integer_column)`
- {ref}`aggregations with ordering <aggregate-function-ordering-during-aggregation>`
- {ref}`aggregations with filter <aggregate-function-filtering-during-aggregation>`

(join-pushdown)=
## Join pushdown

Join pushdown allows the connector to delegate the table join operation to the
underlying data source. This can result in performance gains, and allows Trino
to perform the remaining query processing on a smaller amount of data.

The specifics for the supported pushdown of table joins varies for each data
source, and therefore for each connector.

However, there are some generic conditions that must be met in order for a join
to be pushed down:

- all predicates that are part of the join must be possible to be pushed down
- the tables in the join must be from the same catalog

You can verify if pushdown for a specific join is performed by looking at the
{doc}`EXPLAIN </sql/explain>`  plan of the query. The explain plan does not
show a `Join` operator, if the join is pushed down to the data source by the
connector:

```
EXPLAIN SELECT c.custkey, o.orderkey
FROM orders o JOIN customer c ON c.custkey = o.custkey;
```

The following plan results from the PostgreSQL connector querying TPC-H
data in a PostgreSQL database. It does not show any `Join` operator as a
result of the successful join push down.

```text
Fragment 0 [SINGLE]
    Output layout: [custkey, orderkey]
    Output partitioning: SINGLE []
    Output[custkey, orderkey]
    │   Layout: [custkey:bigint, orderkey:bigint]
    │   Estimates: {rows: ? (?), cpu: ?, memory: 0B, network: ?}
    └─ RemoteSource[1]
           Layout: [orderkey:bigint, custkey:bigint]

Fragment 1 [SOURCE]
    Output layout: [orderkey, custkey]
    Output partitioning: SINGLE []
    TableScan[postgres:Query[SELECT l."orderkey" AS "orderkey_0", l."custkey" AS "custkey_1", r."custkey" AS "custkey_2" FROM (SELECT "orderkey", "custkey" FROM "tpch"."orders") l INNER JOIN (SELECT "custkey" FROM "tpch"."customer") r O
        Layout: [orderkey:bigint, custkey:bigint]
        Estimates: {rows: ? (?), cpu: ?, memory: 0B, network: 0B}
        orderkey := orderkey_0:bigint:int8
        custkey := custkey_1:bigint:int8
```

It is typically beneficial to push down a join. Pushing down a join can also
increase the row count compared to the size of the input to the join. This
may impact performance.

(limit-pushdown)=
## Limit pushdown

A {ref}`limit-clause` reduces the number of returned records for a statement.
Limit pushdown enables a connector to push processing of such queries of
unsorted record to the underlying data source.

A pushdown of this clause can improve the performance of the query and
significantly reduce the amount of data transferred from the data source to
Trino.

Queries include sections such as `LIMIT N` or `FETCH FIRST N ROWS`.

Implementation and support is connector-specific since different data sources have varying capabilities.

(topn-pushdown)=
## Top-N pushdown

The combination of a {ref}`limit-clause` with an {ref}`order-by-clause` creates
a small set of records to return out of a large sorted dataset. It relies on the
order to determine which records need to be returned, and is therefore quite
different to optimize compared to a {ref}`limit-pushdown`.

The pushdown for such a query is called a Top-N pushdown, since the operation is
returning the top N rows. It enables a connector to push processing of such
queries to the underlying data source, and therefore significantly reduces the
amount of data transferred to and processed by Trino.

Queries include sections such as `ORDER BY ... LIMIT N` or `ORDER BY ...
FETCH FIRST N ROWS`.

Implementation and support is connector-specific since different data sources
support different SQL syntax and processing.

For example, you can find two queries to learn how to identify Top-N pushdown behavior in the following section.

First, a concrete example of a Top-N pushdown query on top of a PostgreSQL database:

```
SELECT id, name
FROM postgresql.public.company
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5;
```

You can get the explain plan by prepending the above query with `EXPLAIN`:

```
EXPLAIN SELECT id, name
FROM postgresql.public.company
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5;
```

```text
Fragment 0 [SINGLE]
    Output layout: [id, name]
    Output partitioning: SINGLE []
    Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION
    Output[id, name]
    │   Layout: [id:integer, name:varchar]
    │   Estimates: {rows: ? (?), cpu: ?, memory: 0B, network: ?}
    └─ RemoteSource[1]
           Layout: [id:integer, name:varchar]

Fragment 1 [SOURCE]
    Output layout: [id, name]
    Output partitioning: SINGLE []
    Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION
    TableScan[postgresql:public.company public.company sortOrder=[id:integer:int4 ASC NULLS LAST] limit=5, grouped = false]
        Layout: [id:integer, name:varchar]
        Estimates: {rows: ? (?), cpu: ?, memory: 0B, network: 0B}
        name := name:varchar:text
        id := id:integer:int4
```

Second, an example of a Top-N query on the `tpch` connector which does not support
Top-N pushdown functionality:

```
SELECT custkey, name
FROM tpch.sf1.customer
ORDER BY custkey
LIMIT 5;
```

The related query plan:

```text
Fragment 0 [SINGLE]
    Output layout: [custkey, name]
    Output partitioning: SINGLE []
    Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION
    Output[custkey, name]
    │   Layout: [custkey:bigint, name:varchar(25)]
    │   Estimates: {rows: ? (?), cpu: ?, memory: ?, network: ?}
    └─ TopN[5 by (custkey ASC NULLS LAST)]
       │   Layout: [custkey:bigint, name:varchar(25)]
       └─ LocalExchange[SINGLE] ()
          │   Layout: [custkey:bigint, name:varchar(25)]
          │   Estimates: {rows: ? (?), cpu: ?, memory: ?, network: ?}
          └─ RemoteSource[1]
                 Layout: [custkey:bigint, name:varchar(25)]

Fragment 1 [SOURCE]
    Output layout: [custkey, name]
    Output partitioning: SINGLE []
    Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION
    TopNPartial[5 by (custkey ASC NULLS LAST)]
    │   Layout: [custkey:bigint, name:varchar(25)]
    └─ TableScan[tpch:customer:sf1.0, grouped = false]
           Layout: [custkey:bigint, name:varchar(25)]
           Estimates: {rows: 150000 (4.58MB), cpu: 4.58M, memory: 0B, network: 0B}
           custkey := tpch:custkey
           name := tpch:name
```

In the preceding query plan, the Top-N operation `TopN[5 by (custkey ASC NULLS LAST)]`
is being applied in the `Fragment 0` by Trino and not by the source database.

Note that, compared to the query executed on top of the `tpch` connector,
the explain plan of the query applied on top of the `postgresql` connector
is missing the reference to the operation `TopN[5 by (id ASC NULLS LAST)]`
in the `Fragment 0`.
The absence of the `TopN` Trino operator in the `Fragment 0` from the query plan
demonstrates that the query benefits of the Top-N pushdown optimization.
