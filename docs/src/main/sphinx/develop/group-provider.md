# Group provider

Trino can map usernames onto groups for easier access control management.
This mapping is performed by a `GroupProvider` implementation.

## Implementation

`GroupProviderFactory` is responsible for creating a `GroupProvider` instance.
It also defines the name of the group provider as used in the configuration file.

`GroupProvider` contains a one method, `getGroups(String user)`
which returns a `Set<String>` of group names.
This set of group names becomes part of the `Identity` and `ConnectorIdentity`
objects representing the user, and can then be used by {doc}`system-access-control`.

The implementation of `GroupProvider` and its corresponding `GroupProviderFactory`
must be wrapped as a Trino plugin and installed on the cluster.

## Configuration

After a plugin that implements `GroupProviderFactory` has been installed on the coordinator,
it is configured using an `etc/group-provider.properties` file.
All the properties other than `group-provider.name` are specific to
the `GroupProviderFactory` implementation.

The `group-provider.name` property is used by Trino to find a registered
`GroupProviderFactory` based on the name returned by `GroupProviderFactory.getName()`.
The remaining properties are passed as a map to
`GroupProviderFactory.create(Map<String, String>)`.

Example configuration file:

```text
group-provider.name=custom-group-provider
custom-property1=custom-value1
custom-property2=custom-value2
```

With that file in place, Trino will attempt user group name resolution,
and will be able to use the group names while evaluating access control rules.
