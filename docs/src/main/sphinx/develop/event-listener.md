# Event listener

Trino supports custom event listeners that are invoked for the following
events:

- Query creation
- Query completion (success or failure)
- Split completion (success or failure)

Event details include session, query execution, resource utilization, timeline,
and more.

This functionality enables development of custom logging, debugging and
performance analysis plugins.

## Implementation

`EventListenerFactory` is responsible for creating an
`EventListener` instance. It also defines an `EventListener`
name which is used by the administrator in a Trino configuration.
Implementations of `EventListener` implement methods for the event types
they are interested in handling.

The implementation of `EventListener` and `EventListenerFactory`
must be wrapped as a plugin and installed on the Trino cluster.

## Configuration

After a plugin that implements `EventListener` and
`EventListenerFactory` has been installed on the coordinator, it is
configured using an `etc/event-listener.properties` file. All the
properties other than `event-listener.name` are specific to the
`EventListener` implementation.

The `event-listener.name` property is used by Trino to find a registered
`EventListenerFactory` based on the name returned by
`EventListenerFactory.getName()`. The remaining properties are passed
as a map to `EventListenerFactory.create()`.

Example configuration file:

```text
event-listener.name=custom-event-listener
custom-property1=custom-value1
custom-property2=custom-value2
```

## Multiple event listeners

Trino supports multiple instances of the same or different event listeners.
Install and configure multiple instances by setting
`event-listener.config-files` in {ref}`config-properties` to a comma-separated
list of the event listener configuration files:

```text
event-listener.config-files=etc/event-listener.properties,etc/event-listener-second.properties
```
