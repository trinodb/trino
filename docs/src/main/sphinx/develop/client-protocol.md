# Trino client REST API

The REST API allows clients to submit SQL queries to Trino and receive the
results. Clients include the CLI, the JDBC driver, and others provided by
the community. The preferred method to interact with Trino is using these
existing clients. This document provides details about the API for reference.
It can also be used to implement your own client, if necessary.

Find more information about client drivers, client applications, and the client
protocol configuration in the [client documentation](/client).

## HTTP methods

- A `POST` to `/v1/statement` runs the query string in the `POST` body,
  and returns a JSON document containing the query results. If there are more
  results, the JSON document contains a `nextUri` URL attribute.
- A `GET` to the `nextUri` attribute returns the next batch of query results.
- A `DELETE` to `nextUri` terminates a running query.

## Overview of query processing

A Trino client request is initiated by an HTTP `POST` to the endpoint
`/v1/statement`, with a `POST` body consisting of the SQL query string. The
caller may set various [](client-request-headers). The headers are only
required in the initial `POST` request, and not when following the `nextUri`
links.

If the client request returns an HTTP 502, 503, or 504, that means there was
an intermittent problem processing request and the client should try again in
50-100 ms. Trino does not generate those codes by itself, but those can be
generated by load balancers in front of Trino. 

Additionally, if the request returns a 429 status code, the client should 
retry the request using the `Retry-After` header value provided. 

Any HTTP status other than 502, 503, 504 or 200 means that query processing 
has failed.

The `/v1/statement` `POST` request returns a JSON document of type
`QueryResults`, as well as a collection of response headers. The `QueryResults`
document contains an `error` field of type `QueryError` if the query has failed,
and if that object is not present, the query succeeded. Important aspects of
`QueryResults` are documented in the following sections.

If the `data` field of the JSON document is set, it contains a list of the rows
of data. The `columns` field is set to a list of the names and types of the
columns returned by the query. Most of the response headers are treated like
browser cookies by the client, and echoed back as request headers in subsequent
client requests, as documented below.

If the JSON document returned by the `POST` to `/v1/statement` does not contain
a `nextUri` link, the query has completed, either successfully or
unsuccessfully, and no additional requests need to be made. If the `nextUri`
link is present in the document, there are more query results to be fetched. The
client should loop executing a `GET` request to the `nextUri` returned in the
`QueryResults` response object until `nextUri` is absent from the response.

The `status` field of the JSON document is for human consumption only, and
provides a hint about the query state. It cannot be used to tell if the query
is finished.

## Important `QueryResults` attributes

The most important attributes of the `QueryResults` JSON document returned by
the REST API endpoints are listed in this table. For more details, refer to the
class `io.trino.client.QueryResults` in module `trino-client` in the
`client` directory of the Trino source code.

:::{list-table} QueryResults attributes
:widths: 25, 55
:header-rows: 1

* - Attribute
  - Description
* - `id`
  - The ID of the query.
* - `nextUri`
  - If present, the URL to use for subsequent `GET` or `DELETE` requests. If not
    present, the query is complete or ended in error.
* - `columns`
  - A list of the names and types of the columns returned by the query.
* - `data`
  - The `data` attribute contains a list of the rows returned by the query
    request. Each row is itself a list that holds values of the columns in the
    row, in the order specified by the `columns` attribute.
* - `updateType`
  - A human-readable string representing the operation. For a `CREATE TABLE`
    request, the `updateType` is "CREATE TABLE"; for `SET SESSION` it is "SET
    SESSION"; etc.
* - `error`
  - If query failed, the `error` attribute contains a `QueryError` object. That
    object contains a `message`, an `errorCode` and other information about the
    error. See the `io.trino.client.QueryError` class in module `trino-client`
    in the `client` directory for more details.

## Client request headers

This table lists all supported client request headers. Many of the headers can
be updated in the client as response headers, and supplied in subsequent
requests, just like browser cookies.

:::{list-table} Client request headers
:widths: 30, 50
:header-rows: 1

* - Header name
  - Description
* - `X-Trino-User`
  - Specifies the session user. If not supplied, the session user is
    automatically determined via [](/security/user-mapping).
* - `X-Trino-Original-User`
  - Specifies the session's original user.
* - `X-Trino-Source`
  - For reporting purposes, this supplies the name of the software that
    submitted the query.
* - `X-Trino-Catalog`
  - The catalog context for query processing. Set by response header
    `X-Trino-Set-Catalog`.
* - `X-Trino-Schema`
  - The schema context for query processing. Set by response header
    `X-Trino-Set-Schema`.
* - `X-Trino-Time-Zone`
  - The timezone for query processing. Defaults to the timezone of the Trino
    cluster, and not the timezone of the client.
* - `X-Trino-Language`
  - The language to use when processing the query and formatting results,
    formatted as a Java `Locale` string, for example `en-US` for US English. The
    language of the session can be set on a per-query basis using the
    `X-Trino-Language` HTTP header.
* - `X-Trino-Trace-Token`
  - Supplies a trace token to the Trino engine to help identify log lines that
    originate with this query request.
* - `X-Trino-Session`
  - Supplies a comma-separated list of name=value pairs as session properties.
    When the Trino client run a `SET SESSION name=value` query, the name=value
    pair is returned in the `X-Set-Trino-Session` response header, and added to
    the client's list of session properties. If the response header
    `X-Trino-Clear-Session` is returned, its value is the name of a session
    property that is removed from the client's accumulated list.
* - `X-Trino-Role`
  - Sets the "role" for query processing. A "role" represents a collection of
    permissions. Set by response header `X-Trino-Set-Role`. See
    [](/sql/create-role) to understand roles.
* - `X-Trino-Prepared-Statement`
  - A comma-separated list of the name=value pairs, where the names are names of
    previously prepared SQL statements, and the values are keys that identify
    the executable form of the named prepared statements.
* - `X-Trino-Transaction-Id`
  - The transaction ID to use for query processing. Set by response header
    `X-Trino-Started-Transaction-Id` and cleared by
    `X-Trino-Clear-Transaction-Id`.
* - `X-Trino-Client-Info`
  - Contains arbitrary information about the client program submitting the
    query.
* - `X-Trino-Client-Tags`
  - A comma-separated list of "tag" strings, used to identify Trino resource
    groups.
* - `X-Trino-Resource-Estimate`
  - A comma-separated list of `resource=value` type assignments. The possible
    choices of `resource` are `EXECUTION_TIME`, `CPU_TIME`,  `PEAK_MEMORY` and
    `PEAK_TASK_MEMORY`. `EXECUTION_TIME` and `CPU_TIME` have values specified
    as airlift `Duration` strings The format is a double precision number
    followed by a `TimeUnit` string, for example `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes,
    `h` for hours, etc. "PEAK_MEMORY" and "PEAK_TASK_MEMORY" are specified as
    airlift `DataSize` strings, whose format is an integer followed by `B` for
    bytes; `kB` for kilobytes; `mB` for megabytes, `gB` for gigabytes, etc.
* - `X-Trino-Extra-Credential`
  - Provides extra credentials to the connector. The header is a name=value
    string that is saved in the session `Identity` object. The name and value
    are only meaningful to the connector.
