# SET

## Synopsis

```text
SET identifier = expression
```

## Description

Use the `SET` statement in [](/udf/sql) to assign a value to a variable,
referenced by comma-separated `identifier`s. The value is determined by
evaluating the `expression` after the `=` sign.

Before the assignment the variable must be defined with a `DECLARE` statement.
The data type of the variable must be identical to the data type of evaluating
the `expression`.

## Examples

The following functions returns the value `1` after setting the counter variable
multiple times to different values:

```sql
FUNCTION one()
  RETURNS bigint
  BEGIN
    DECLARE counter tinyint DEFAULT 1;
    SET counter = 0;
    SET counter = counter + 2;
    SET counter = counter / counter;
    RETURN counter;
  END
```

Further examples of varying complexity that cover usage of the `SET` statement
in combination with other statements are available in the [](/udf/sql/examples).
