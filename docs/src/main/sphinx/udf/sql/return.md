# RETURN

## Synopsis

```text
RETURN expression
```

## Description

Provide the value from a [](/udf/sql) to the caller. The value is the result of
evaluating the expression. It can be a static value, a declared variable or a
more complex expression.

## Examples

The following examples return a static value, the result of an expression, and
the value of the variable x:

```sql
RETURN 42;
RETURN 6 * 7;
RETURN x;
```

Further examples of varying complexity that cover usage of the `RETURN`
statement in combination with other statements are available in the
[](/udf/sql/examples).

All SQL UDFs must contain a `RETURN` statement at the end of the top-level block
in the `FUNCTION` declaration, even if it's unreachable.
