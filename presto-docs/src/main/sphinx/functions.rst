Functions and Operators
***********************

This chapter describes the SQL functions and operators supported by Presto. They
allow you to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by
Presto operating on the underlying data sources.

Ensure to also consult our reference to the :doc:`supported SQL data
types</language>` and other general characteristics and a :doc:`full SQL
statement and syntax reference</sql>` are available.

If you are looking for more information about a specific function or operator,
:doc:`see our complete list</functions/list>`.
