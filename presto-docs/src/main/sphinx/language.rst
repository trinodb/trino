Presto is an ANSI SQL compliant query engine. This standard compliance allows
Presto users to integrate their favorite data tools, including BI and ETL tools
with any underlying data source.

Presto validates and translates the received SQL statements into the necessary
operations on the connected data source.

This chapter provides a reference to the supported SQL data types and other
general characteristics of the SQL support of Presto.

A :doc:`full SQL statement and syntax reference<sql>` is
